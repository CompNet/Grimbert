<chapter>THE STEPPE

THE STORY OF A JOURNEY

I

EARLY one morning in July a shabby covered chaise, one of those antediluvian chaises without springs in which no one travels in Russia nowadays, except merchant's clerks, dealers and the less well-to-do among priests, drove out of N., the principal town of the province of Z., and rumbled noisily along the posting-track. It rattled and creaked at every movement; the pail, hanging on behind, chimed in gruffly, and from these sounds alone and from the wretched rags of leather hanging loose about its peeling body one could judge of its decrepit age and readiness to drop to pieces.

Two of the inhabitants of N. were sitting in the chaise; they were a merchant of N. called Ivan Ivanitch Kuzmitchov, a man with a shaven face wearing glasses and a straw hat, more like a government clerk than a merchant, and Father Christopher Sireysky, the priest of the Church of St. Nikolay at N., a little old man with long hair, in a grey canvas cassock, a wide-brimmed top-hat and a coloured embroidered girdle. The former was absorbed in thought, and kept tossing his head to shake off drowsiness; in his countenance an habitual business-like reserve was struggling with the genial expression of a man who has just said good-bye to his relatives and has had a good drink at parting. The latter gazed with moist eyes wonderingly at God's world, and his smile was so broad that it seemed to embrace even the brim of his hat; his face was red and looked frozen. Both of them, <mention>Father Christopher</mention> as well as Kuzmitchov, were going to sell wool. At parting with their families they had just eaten heartily of pastry puffs and cream, and although it was so early in the morning had had a glass or two. . . . Both were in the best of humours.

Apart from the two persons described above and the coachman Deniska, who lashed the pair of frisky bay horses, there was another figure in the chaise -- a boy of nine with a sunburnt face, wet with tears. This was <mention>Yegorushka</mention>, Kuzmitchov's nephew. With the sanction of his uncle and the blessing of <mention>Father Christopher</mention>, he was now on his way to go to school. His mother, Olga Ivanovna, the widow of a collegiate secretary, and Kuzmitchov's sister, who was fond of educated people and refined society, had entreated her brother to take <mention>Yegorushka</mention> with him when he went to sell wool and to put him to school; and now the boy was sitting on the box beside the coachman <mention>Deniska</mention>, holding on to his elbow to keep from falling off, and dancing up and down like a kettle on the hob, with no notion where he was going or what he was going for. The rapid motion through the air blew out his red shirt like a balloon on his back and made his new hat with a peacock's feather in it, like a coachman's, keep slipping on to the back of his head. He felt himself an intensely unfortunate person, and had an inclination to cry.

When the chaise drove past the prison, <mention>Yegorushka</mention> glanced at the sentinels pacing slowly by the high white walls, at the little barred windows, at the cross shining on the roof, and remembered how the week before, on the day of the Holy Mother of Kazan, he had been with his mother to the prison church for the Dedication Feast, and how before that, at Easter, he had gone to the prison with <mention>Deniska</mention> and Ludmila the cook, and had taken the prisoners Easter bread, eggs, cakes and roast beef. The prisoners had thanked them and made the sign of the cross, and one of them had given <mention>Yegorushka</mention> a pewter buckle of his own making.

The boy gazed at the familiar places, while the hateful chaise flew by and left them all behind. After the prison he caught glimpses of black grimy foundries, followed by the snug green cemetery surrounded by a wall of cobblestones; white crosses and tombstones, nestling among green cherry-trees and looking in the distance like patches of white, peeped out gaily from behind the wall. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> remembered that when the cherries were in blossom those white patches melted with the flowers into a sea of white; and that when the cherries were ripe the white tombstones and crosses were dotted with splashes of red like bloodstains. Under the cherry trees in the cemetery Yegorushka's father and granny, Zinaida Danilovna, lay sleeping day and night. When Granny had died she had been put in a long narrow coffin and two pennies had been put upon her eyes, which would not keep shut. Up to the time of her death she had been brisk, and used to bring soft rolls covered with poppy seeds from the market. Now she did nothing but sleep and sleep. . . .

Beyond the cemetery came the smoking brickyards. From under the long roofs of reeds that looked as though pressed flat to the ground, a thick black smoke rose in great clouds and floated lazily upwards. The sky was murky above the brickyards and the cemetery, and great shadows from the clouds of smoke crept over the fields and across the roads. Men and horses covered with red dust were moving about in the smoke near the roofs.

The town ended with the brickyards and the open country began. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> looked at the town for the last time, pressed his face against Deniska's elbow, and wept bitterly.

<quote connection="s76" id="s2630" mention="named35" oid="3" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov" addressees="Yegorushka">"Do you want to go back?"</quote> asked <mention connection="s2630,s2632" entity="entity5" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s76" mentiontype="name" oid="named35" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Kuzmitchov</mention>.

<quote connection="s77" id="s2631" mention="named36" oid="4" speaker="Yegorushka" addressees="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"Yes, . . . yes, . . ."</quote> answered <mention connection="s2631" entity="entity11" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s77" mentiontype="name" oid="named36" speaker="Yegorushka">Yegorushka</mention>, sobbing.

<quote connection="s76" id="s2632" mention="named35" oid="5" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov" addressees="Yegorushka">"Well, you'd better go back then. Anyway, you are going for nothing; it's a day's journey for a spoonful of porridge."</quote>

<quote connection="s79" id="s2633" mention="named37" oid="6" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky" addressees="Yegorushka">"Never mind, never mind, my boy,"</quote> <mention connection="s2633,s2634,s2637,s2639" entity="entity6" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s79" mentiontype="name" oid="named37" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">Father Christopher</mention> went on. <quote connection="s79" id="s2634" mention="named37" oid="7" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky" addressees="Yegorushka">"Call upon God. . . . Lomonosov set off with the fishermen in the same way, and he became a man famous all over Europe. Learning in conjunction with faith brings forth fruit pleasing to God. What are the words of the prayer? For the glory of our Maker, for the comfort of our parents, for the benefit of our Church and our country. . . . Yes, indeed!"</quote>

<quote connection="s87" id="s2635" mention="named42" oid="8" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov" addressees="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"The benefit is not the same in all cases,"</quote> said <mention connection="s2635,s2636,s2638" entity="entity5" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s87" mentiontype="name" oid="named42" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Kuzmitchov</mention>, lighting a cheap cigar; <quote connection="s87" id="s2636" mention="named42" oid="9" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov" addressees="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"some will study twenty years and get no sense from it."</quote>

<quote connection="s79" id="s2637" mention="named37" oid="10" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky" addressees="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"That does happen."</quote>

<quote connection="s87" id="s2638" mention="named42" oid="11" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov" addressees="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"Learning is a benefit to some, but others only muddle their brains. My sister is a woman who does not understand; she is set upon refinement, and wants to turn Yegorka into a learned man, and she does not understand that with my business I could settle Yegorka happily for the rest of his life. I tell you this, that if everyone were to go in for being learned and refined there would be no one to sow the corn and do the trading; they would all die of hunger."</quote>

<quote connection="s79" id="s2639" mention="named37" oid="12" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky" addressees="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"And if all go in for trading and sowing corn there will be no one to acquire learning."</quote>

And considering that each of them had said something weighty and convincing, Kuzmitchov and <mention>Father Christopher</mention> both looked serious and cleared their throats simultaneously.

<mention>Deniska</mention>, who had been listening to their conversation without understanding a word of it, shook his head and, rising in his seat, lashed at both the bays. A silence followed.

Meanwhile a wide boundless plain encircled by a chain of low hills lay stretched before the travellers' eyes. Huddling together and peeping out from behind one another, these hills melted together into rising ground, which stretched right to the very horizon and disappeared into the lilac distance; one drives on and on and cannot discern where it begins or where it ends. . . . The sun had already peeped out from beyond the town behind them, and quietly, without fuss, set to its accustomed task. At first in the distance before them a broad, bright, yellow streak of light crept over the ground where the earth met the sky, near the little barrows and the windmills, which in the distance looked like tiny men waving their arms. A minute later a similar streak gleamed a little nearer, crept to the right and embraced the hills. Something warm touched Yegorushka's spine; the streak of light, stealing up from behind, darted between the chaise and the horses, moved to meet the other streak, and soon the whole wide steppe flung off the twilight of early morning, and was smiling and sparkling with dew.

The cut rye, the coarse steppe grass, the milkwort, the wild hemp, all withered from the sultry heat, turned brown and half dead, now washed by the dew and caressed by the sun, revived, to fade again. Arctic petrels flew across the road with joyful cries; marmots called to one another in the grass. Somewhere, far away to the left, lapwings uttered their plaintive notes. <mention class="partridges" connection="s2640" entity="organism55" entitytype="PERSON" gender="plural" id="s105" mentiontype="nominal" modifier="covey of" oid="organism55" speaker="a_covey_of_partridges">A covey of partridges</mention>, scared by the chaise, fluttered up and with their soft <quote connection="s105" id="s2640" mention="organism55" oid="13" speaker="a_covey_of_partridges">"trrrr!"</quote> flew off to the hills. In the grass crickets, locusts and grasshoppers kept up their churring, monotonous music.

But a little time passed, the dew evaporated, the air grew stagnant, and the disillusioned steppe began to wear its jaded July aspect. The grass drooped, everything living was hushed. The sun-baked hills, brownish-green and lilac in the distance, with their quiet shadowy tones, the plain with the misty distance and, arched above them, the sky, which seems terribly deep and transparent in the steppes, where there are no woods or high hills, seemed now endless, petrified with dreariness. . . .

How stifling and oppressive it was! The chaise raced along, while <mention>Yegorushka</mention> saw always the same-- the sky, the plain, the low hills . . . . The music in the grass was hushed, the petrels had flown away, the partridges were out of sight, rooks hovered idly over the withered grass; they were all alike and made the steppe even more monotonous.

A hawk flew just above the ground, with an even sweep of its wings, suddenly halted in the air as though pondering on the dreariness of life, then fluttered its wings and flew like an arrow over the steppe, and there was no telling why it flew off and what it wanted. In the distance a windmill waved its sails. . . .

Now and then a glimpse of a white potsherd or a heap of stones broke the monotony; a grey stone stood out for an instant or a parched willow with a blue crow on its top branch; a marmot would run across the road and-- again there flitted before the eyes only the high grass, the low hills, the rooks. . . .

But at last, thank God, a waggon loaded with sheaves came to meet them; a peasant wench was lying on the very top. Sleepy, exhausted by the heat, she lifted her head and looked at the travellers. <mention>Deniska</mention> gaped, looking at her; the horses stretched out their noses towards the sheaves; the chaise, squeaking, kissed the waggon, and the pointed ears passed over Father Christopher's hat like a brush.

<quote connection="s119" id="s2641" mention="named55" oid="14" speaker="Deniska" addressees="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"You are driving over folks, fatty!"</quote> cried <mention connection="s2641,s2642" entity="entity10" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s119" mentiontype="name" oid="named55" speaker="Deniska">Deniska</mention>. <quote connection="s119" id="s2642" mention="named55" oid="15" speaker="Deniska" addressees="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"What a swollen lump of a face, as though a bumble-bee had stung it!"</quote>

The girl smiled drowsily, and moving her lips lay down again; then a solitary poplar came into sight on the low hill. Someone had planted it, and God only knows why it was there. It was hard to tear the eyes away from its graceful figure and green drapery. Was that lovely creature happy? Sultry heat in summer, in winter frost and snowstorms, terrible nights in autumn when nothing is to be seen but darkness and nothing is to be heard but the senseless angry howling wind, and, worst of all, alone, alone for the whole of life . . . . Beyond the poplar stretches of wheat extended like a bright yellow carpet from the road to the top of the hills. On the hills the corn was already cut and laid up in sheaves, while at the bottom they were still cutting. . . . Six mowers were standing in a row swinging their scythes, and <mention connection="s2643" id="s2661" speaker="the_scythes">the scythes</mention> gleamed gaily and uttered in unison together <quote connection="s2661" id="s2643" oid="16" speaker="the_scythes" addressees="">"Vzhee, vzhee!"</quote> From the movements of the peasant women binding the sheaves, from the faces of <mention>the mowers</mention>, from the glitter of <mention>the scythes</mention>, it could be seen that the sultry heat was baking and stifling. A black dog with its tongue hanging out ran from <mention>the mowers</mention> to meet the chaise, probably with the intention of barking, but stopped halfway and stared indifferently at <mention>Deniska</mention>, who shook his whip at him; it was too hot to bark! One peasant woman got up and, putting both hands to her aching back, followed Yegorushka's red shirt with her eyes. Whether it was that the colour pleased her or that he reminded her of her children, she stood a long time motionless staring after him.

But now the wheat, too, had flashed by; again the parched plain, the sunburnt hills, the sultry sky stretched before them; again a hawk hovered over the earth. In the distance, as before, a windmill whirled its sails, and still it looked like a little man waving his arms. It was wearisome to watch, and it seemed as though one would never reach it, as though it were running away from the chaise.

<mention>Father Christopher</mention> and Kuzmitchov were silent. <mention>Deniska</mention> lashed the horses and kept shouting to them, while <mention connection="s2644" entity="entity11" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s136" mentiontype="name" oid="named61" speaker="Yegorushka">Yegorushka</mention> had left off crying, and gazed about him listlessly. The heat and the tedium of the steppes overpowered him. He felt as though he had been travelling and jolting up and down for a very long time, that the sun had been baking his back a long time. Before they had gone eight miles he began to feel <quote connection="s136" id="s2644" mention="named61" oid="17" speaker="Yegorushka" addressees="">"It must be time to rest."</quote> The geniality gradually faded out of his uncle's face and nothing else was left but the air of business reserve; and to a gaunt shaven face, especially when it is adorned with spectacles and the nose and temples are covered with dust, this reserve gives a relentless, inquisitorial appearance. <mention>Father Christopher</mention> never left off gazing with wonder at God's world, and smiling. Without speaking, he brooded over something pleasant and nice, and a kindly, genial smile remained imprinted on his face. It seemed as though some nice and pleasant thought were imprinted on his brain by the heat.

<quote connection="s144" id="s2645" mention="named65" oid="18" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov" addressees="Deniska">"Well, Deniska, shall we overtake the waggons to-day?"</quote> asked <mention connection="s2645" entity="entity5" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s144" mentiontype="name" oid="named65" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Kuzmitchov</mention>.

<mention connection="s2646" entity="entity10" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s145" mentiontype="name" oid="named67" speaker="Deniska">Deniska</mention> looked at the sky, rose in his seat, lashed at his horses and then answered:

<quote connection="s145" id="s2646" mention="named67" oid="19" speaker="Deniska" addressees="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"By nightfall, please God, we shall overtake them."</quote>

There was a sound of dogs barking. Half a dozen steppe sheep-dogs, suddenly leaping out as though from ambush, with ferocious howling barks, flew to meet the chaise. All of them, extraordinarily furious, surrounded the chaise, with their shaggy spider-like muzzles and their eyes red with anger, and jostling against one another in their anger, raised a hoarse howl. They were filled with passionate hatred of the horses, of the chaise, and of the human beings, and seemed ready to tear them into pieces. <mention>Deniska</mention>, who was fond of teasing and beating, was delighted at the chance of it, and with a malignant expression bent over and lashed at the sheep-dogs with his whip. The brutes growled more than ever, the horses flew on; and <mention>Yegorushka</mention>, who had difficulty in keeping his seat on the box, realized, looking at the dogs' eyes and teeth, that if he fell down they would instantly tear him to bits; but he felt no fear and looked at them as malignantly as <mention>Deniska</mention>, and regretted that he had no whip in his hand.

The chaise came upon a flock of sheep.

<quote connection="s161" id="s2647" mention="named72" oid="20" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov" addressees="Deniska">"Stop!"</quote> cried <mention connection="s2647,s2648" entity="entity5" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s161" mentiontype="name" oid="named72" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Kuzmitchov</mention>. <quote connection="s161" id="s2648" mention="named72" oid="21" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov" addressees="Deniska">"Pull up! Woa!"</quote>

Deniska threw his whole body backwards and pulled up the horses.

<quote connection="s164" id="s2649" mention="named74" oid="22" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov" addressees="old_shepherd_1">"Come here!"</quote> <mention connection="s2649,s2650" entity="entity5" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s164" mentiontype="name" oid="named74" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Kuzmitchov</mention> shouted to the shepherd. <quote connection="s164" id="s2650" mention="named74" oid="23" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov" addressees="old_shepherd_1">"Call off the dogs, curse them!"</quote>

The old shepherd, tattered and barefoot, wearing a fur cap, with a dirty sack round his loins and a long crook in his hand -- a regular figure from the Old Testament-- called off the dogs, and taking off his cap, went up to the chaise. Another similar Old Testament figure was standing motionless at the other end of the flock, staring without interest at the travellers.

<quote connection="s170" id="s2651" mention="named75" oid="24" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov" addressees="old_shepherd_1">"Whose sheep are these?"</quote> asked <mention connection="s2651,s2654,s2656,s2658" entity="entity5" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s170" mentiontype="name" oid="named75" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Kuzmitchov</mention>.

<quote connection="s2660" id="s2653" oid="26" speaker="old_shepherd_2" addressees="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"Varlamov's,"</quote> repeated <mention connection="s2653" id="s2660" speaker="old_shepherd_2">the shepherd</mention> standing at the other end of the flock.

<quote connection="s170" id="s2654" mention="named75" oid="27" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov" addressees="old_shepherd_1">"Did <mention>Varlamov</mention> come this way yesterday or not?"</quote>

<quote connection="s172" id="s2655" mention="organism96" oid="28" speaker="old_shepherd_1" addressees="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"He did not; his clerk came. . . ."</quote>

<quote connection="s170" id="s2656" mention="named75" oid="29" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov" addressees="Deniska">"Drive on!"</quote>

The chaise rolled on and the shepherds, with their angry dogs, were left behind. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> gazed listlessly at the lilac distance in front, and it began to seem as though the windmill, waving its sails, were getting nearer. It became bigger and bigger, grew quite large, and now he could distinguish clearly its two sails. One sail was old and patched, the other had only lately been made of new wood and glistened in the sun. The chaise drove straight on, while the windmill, for some reason, began retreating to the left. They drove on and on, and the windmill kept moving away to the left, and still did not disappear.

<quote connection="s185" id="s2657" mention="named80" oid="30" speaker="Deniska" addressees="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"A fine windmill Boltva has put up for his son,"</quote> observed <mention connection="s2657,s2659" entity="entity10" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s185" mentiontype="name" oid="named80" speaker="Deniska">Deniska</mention>.

<quote connection="s170" id="s2658" mention="named75" oid="31" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov" addressees="Deniska">"And how is it we don't see his farm?"</quote>

Boltva's farm, too, soon came into sight, but yet the windmill did not retreat, did not drop behind; it still watched <mention>Yegorushka</mention> with its shining sail and waved. What a sorcerer!</chapter><chapter>II

Towards midday the chaise turned off the road to the right; it went on a little way at walking pace and then stopped. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> heard a soft, very caressing gurgle, and felt a different air breathe on his face with a cool velvety touch. Through a little pipe of hemlock stuck there by some unknown benefactor, water was running in a thin trickle from a low hill, put together by nature of huge monstrous stones. It fell to the ground, and limpid, sparkling gaily in the sun, and softly murmuring as though fancying itself a great tempestuous torrent, flowed swiftly away to the left. Not far from its source the little stream spread itself out into a pool; the burning sunbeams and the parched soil greedily drank it up and sucked away its strength; but a little further on it must have mingled with another rivulet, for a hundred paces away thick reeds showed green and luxuriant along its course, and three snipe flew up from them with a loud cry as the chaise drove by.

The travellers got out to rest by the stream and feed the horses. Kuzmitchov, <mention>Father Christopher</mention> and <mention>Yegorushka</mention> sat down on a mat in the narrow strip of shade cast by the chaise and the unharnessed horses. The nice pleasant thought that the heat had imprinted in Father Christopher's brain craved expression after he had had a drink of water and eaten a hard-boiled egg. <mention connection="s5322" id="s5365" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">He</mention> bent a friendly look upon <mention>Yegorushka</mention>, munched, and began:

<quote connection="s5365" id="s5322" mention="named85" oid="33" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"I studied too, my boy; from the earliest age God instilled into me good sense and understanding, so that while I was just such a lad as you I was beyond others, a comfort to my parents and preceptors by my good sense. Before I was fifteen I could speak and make verses in Latin, just as in Russian. I was the crosier-bearer to his Holiness <mention>Bishop Christopher</mention>. After mass one day, as I remember it was the patron saint's day of His Majesty Tsar Alexandr Pavlovitch of blessed memory, <mention connection="s5323" id="s5367" speaker="Bishop_Christopher">he</mention> unrobed at the altar, looked kindly at me and asked, <quote connection="s5367" id="s5323" oid="" speaker="Bishop_Christopher">'Puer bone, quam appelaris?'</quote> And <mention connection="s5324" id="s5371" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">I</mention> answered, <quote connection="s5371" id="s5324" oid="" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">'Christopherus sum;'</quote> and <mention connection="s5325" id="s5368" speaker="Bishop_Christopher">he</mention> said, <quote connection="s5368" id="s5325" oid="" speaker="Bishop_Christopher">'Ergo connominati sumus'</quote>-- that is, that we were namesakes. . .

Before I had moustaches, my boy, I could read Latin, Greek, and French; I knew philosophy, mathematics, secular history, and all the sciences. The Lord gave me a marvellous memory. Sometimes, if I read a thing once or twice, I knew it by heart. My preceptors and patrons were amazed, and so they expected I should make a learned man, a luminary of the Church. I did think of going to Kiev to continue my studies, but my parents did not approve. <quote connection="s5377" id="s5328" oid="" speaker="Father_Christopher's_father">'You'll be studying all your life,'</quote> said <mention connection="s5328,s5329" id="s5377" speaker="Father_Christopher's_father">my father</mention>; <quote connection="s5377" id="s5329" oid="" speaker="Father_Christopher's_father">'when shall we see you finished?'</quote> Hearing such words, I gave up study and took a post. . . . Of course, I did not become a learned man, but then I did not disobey my parents; I was a comfort to them in their old age and gave them a creditable funeral.

<quote connection="s5378" id="s5376" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">I suppose you have forgotten all your learning?"</quote> observed <mention connection="s5376" id="s5378" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Kuzmitchov</mention>.

<mention connection="s5331,s5330" id="s5373" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">Father Christopher</mention> screwed up his eyes, thought a minute and said in an undertone:

He shook his head and laughed with feeling.

Among the sedge were flying the three snipe they had seen before, and in their plaintive cries there was a note of alarm and vexation at having been driven away from the stream. The horses were steadily munching and snorting. <mention>Deniska</mention> walked about by them and, trying to appear indifferent to the cucumbers, pies, and eggs that the gentry were eating, he concentrated himself on the gadflies and horseflies that were fastening upon the horses' backs and bellies; he squashed his victims apathetically, emitting a peculiar, fiendishly triumphant, guttural sound, and when he missed them cleared his throat with an air of vexation and looked after every lucky one that escaped death.

<quote connection="s2935" id="s5337" mention="named139" oid="41" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"Deniska, where are you? Come and eat,"</quote> said <mention connection="s5337" entity="entity5" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s2935" mentiontype="name" oid="named139" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Kuzmitchov</mention>, heaving a deep sigh, a sign that he had had enough.

<mention>Deniska</mention> diffidently approached the mat and picked out five thick and yellow cucumbers (he did not venture to take the smaller and fresher ones), took two hard-boiled eggs that looked dark and were cracked, then irresolutely, as though afraid he might get a blow on his outstretched hand, touched a pie with his finger.

<quote connection="s2938" id="s5338" mention="named142" oid="42" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"Take them, take them,"</quote> <mention connection="s5338" entity="entity5" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s2938" mentiontype="name" oid="named142" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Kuzmitchov</mention> urged him on.

<mention>Deniska</mention> took the pies resolutely, and, moving some distance away, sat down on the grass with his back to the chaise. At once there was such a sound of loud munching that even the horses turned round to look suspiciously at <mention>Deniska</mention>.

After his meal <mention connection="s5339" entity="entity5" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s2942" mentiontype="name" oid="named146" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Kuzmitchov</mention> took a sack containing something out of the chaise and said to <mention>Yegorushka</mention>:

<quote connection="s2942" id="s5339" mention="named146" oid="43" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"I am going to sleep, and you mind that no one takes the sack from under my head."</quote>

Father Christopher took off his cassock, his girdle, and his full coat, and <mention>Yegorushka</mention>, looking at him, was dumb with astonishment. He had never imagined that priests wore trousers, and <mention>Father Christopher</mention> had on real canvas trousers thrust into high boots, and a short striped jacket. Looking at him, <mention>Yegorushka</mention> thought that in this costume, so unsuitable to his dignified position, he looked with his long hair and beard very much like Robinson Crusoe. After taking off their outer garments Kuzmitchov and <mention>Father Christopher</mention> lay down in the shade under the chaise, facing one another, and closed their eyes. <mention>Deniska</mention>, who had finished munching, stretched himself out on his back and also closed his eyes.

<quote connection="s5375" id="s5340" mention="named155" oid="44" speaker="Deniska">"You look out that no one takes away the horses!"</quote> <mention connection="s5340" id="s5375" speaker="Deniska">he</mention> said to <mention>Yegorushka</mention>, and at once fell asleep.

Stillness reigned. There was no sound except the munching and snorting of the horses and the snoring of the sleepers; somewhere far away a lapwing wailed, and from time to time there sounded the shrill cries of the three snipe who had flown up to see whether their uninvited visitors had gone away; the rivulet babbled, lisping softly, but all these sounds did not break the stillness, did not stir the stagnation, but, on the contrary, lulled all nature to slumber.

<mention>Yegorushka</mention>, gasping with the heat, which was particularly oppressive after a meal, ran to the sedge and from there surveyed the country. He saw exactly the same as he had in the morning: the plain, the low hills, the sky, the lilac distance; only the hills stood nearer; and he could not see the windmill, which had been left far behind. From behind the rocky hill from which the stream flowed rose another, smoother and broader; a little hamlet of five or six homesteads clung to it. No people, no trees, no shade were to be seen about the huts; it looked as though the hamlet had expired in the burning air and was dried up. To while away the time <mention>Yegorushka</mention> caught a grasshopper in the grass, held it in his closed hand to his ear, and spent a long time listening to the creature playing on its instrument. When he was weary of its music he ran after a flock of yellow butterflies who were flying towards the sedge on the watercourse, and found himself again beside the chaise, without noticing how he came there. His uncle and <mention>Father Christopher</mention> were sound asleep; their sleep would be sure to last two or three hours till the horses had rested. . . . How was he to get through that long time, and where was he to get away from the heat? A hard problem. . . . Mechanically Yegorushka put his lips to the trickle that ran from the waterpipe; there was a chilliness in his mouth and there was the smell of hemlock. He drank at first eagerly, then went on with effort till the sharp cold had run from his mouth all over his body and the water was spilt on his shirt. Then he went up to the chaise and began looking at the sleeping figures. His uncle's face wore, as before, an expression of business-like reserve. Fanatically devoted to his work, <mention connection="s5341" id="s5385" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Kuzmitchov </mention>always, even in his sleep and at church when they were singing, <quote connection="s5385" id="s5341" oid="45" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"Like the cherubim,"</quote> thought about his business and could never forget it for a moment; and now he was probably dreaming about bales of wool, waggons, prices, Varlamov. . . . <mention>Father Christopher</mention>, now, a soft, frivolous and absurd person, had never all his life been conscious of anything which could, like a boa-constrictor, coil about his soul and hold it tight. In all the numerous enterprises he had undertaken in his day what attracted him was not so much the business itself, but the bustle and the contact with other people involved in every undertaking. Thus, in the present expedition, he was not so much interested in wool, in <mention>Varlamov</mention>, and in prices, as in the long journey, the conversations on the way, the sleeping under a chaise, and the meals at odd times. . . . And now, judging from his face, he must have been dreaming of <mention>Bishop Christopher</mention>, of the Latin discussion, of his wife, of puffs and cream and all sorts of things that Kuzmitchov could not possibly dream of.

While <mention>Yegorushka</mention> was watching their sleeping faces he suddenly heard a soft singing; somewhere at a distance a woman was singing, and it was difficult to tell where and in what direction. The song was subdued, dreary and melancholy, like a dirge, and hardly audible, and seemed to come first from the right, then from the left, then from above, and then from underground, as though an unseen spirit were hovering over the steppe and singing. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> looked about him, and could not make out where the strange song came from. Then as he listened he began to fancy that the grass was singing; in its song, withered and half-dead, it was without words, but plaintively and passionately, urging that it was not to blame, that the sun was burning it for no fault of its own; it urged that it ardently longed to live, that it was young and might have been beautiful but for the heat and the drought; it was guiltless, but yet it prayed forgiveness and protested that it was in anguish, sad and sorry for itself. . . .

<mention>Yegorushka</mention> listened for a little, and it began to seem as though this dreary, mournful song made the air hotter, more suffocating and more stagnant. . . . To drown the singing he ran to the sedge, humming to himself and trying to make a noise with his feet. From there he looked about in all directions and found out who was singing. Near the furthest hut in the hamlet stood <mention>a peasant woman</mention> in a short petticoat, with long thin legs like a heron. She was sowing something. A white dust floated languidly from her sieve down the hillock. Now it was evident that she was singing. A couple of yards from her a little bare-headed boy in nothing but a smock was standing motionless. As though fascinated by the song, he stood stock-still, staring away into the distance, probably at Yegorushka's crimson shirt.

The song ceased. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> sauntered back to the chaise, and to while away the time went again to the trickle of water.

And again there was <mention>the sound</mention> of the dreary song. It was the same long-legged peasant woman in the hamlet over the hill. Yegorushka's boredom came back again. He left the pipe and looked upwards. What he saw was so unexpected that he was a little frightened. Just above his head on one of the big clumsy stones stood a chubby little boy, wearing nothing but a shirt, with a prominent stomach and thin legs, the same boy who had been standing before by the peasant woman. He was gazing with open mouth and unblinking eyes at Yegorushka's crimson shirt and at the chaise, with a look of blank astonishment and even fear, as though he saw before him creatures of another world. The red colour of the shirt charmed and allured him. But the chaise and the men sleeping under it excited his curiosity; perhaps he had not noticed how the agreeable red colour and curiosity had attracted him down from the hamlet, and now probably he was surprised at his own boldness. For a long while <mention>Yegorushka</mention> stared at him, and he at <mention>Yegorushka</mention>. Both were silent and conscious of some awkwardness. After a long silence <mention connection="s5342" entity="entity11" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s2999" mentiontype="name" oid="named177" speaker="Yegorushka">Yegorushka</mention> asked:

<quote connection="s2999" id="s5342" mention="named177" oid="46" speaker="Yegorushka">"What's your name?"</quote>

<mention class="stranger" connection="s5343" entity="organism161" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s3000" mentiontype="nominal" modifier="" oid="organism161" speaker="Tit">The stranger</mention>'s cheeks puffed out more than ever; he pressed his back against the rock, opened his eyes wide, moved his lips, and answered in a husky bass: <quote connection="s3000" id="s5343" mention="organism161" oid="47" speaker="Tit">"Tit!"</quote>

The boys said not another word to each other; after a brief silence, still keeping his eyes fixed on <mention>Yegorushka</mention>, the mysterious Tit kicked up one leg, felt with his heel for a niche and clambered up the rock; from that point he ascended to the next rock, staggering backwards and looking intently at <mention>Yegorushka</mention>, as though afraid he might hit him from behind, and so made his way upwards till he disappeared altogether behind the crest of the hill.

After watching him out of sight, <mention>Yegorushka</mention> put his arms round his knees and leaned his head on them. . . . The burning sun scorched the back of his head, his neck, and his spine. The melancholy song died away, then floated again on the stagnant stifling air. The rivulet gurgled monotonously, the horses munched, and time dragged on endlessly, as though it, too, were stagnant and had come to a standstill. It seemed as though a hundred years had passed since the morning. Could it be that God's world, the chaise and the horses would come to a standstill in that air, and, like the hills, turn to stone and remain for ever in one spot? <mention>Yegorushka</mention> raised his head, and with smarting eyes looked before him; the lilac distance, which till then had been motionless, began heaving, and with the sky floated away into the distance. . . . It drew after it the brown grass, the sedge, and with extraordinary swiftness Yegorushka floated after the flying distance. Some force noiselessly drew him onwards, and the heat and the wearisome song flew after in pursuit. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> bent his head and shut his eyes. . . .

<mention connection="s5344" entity="entity10" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s3016" mentiontype="name" oid="named185" speaker="Deniska">Deniska</mention> was the first to wake up. Something must have bitten him, for he jumped up, quickly scratched his shoulder and said:

<quote connection="s3016" id="s5344" mention="named185" oid="48" speaker="Deniska">"Plague take you, cursed idolater!"</quote>

Then he went to the brook, had a drink and slowly washed. His splashing and puffing roused <mention>Yegorushka</mention> from his lethargy. <mention class="boy" connection="s5345" entity="organism170" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s3018" mentiontype="nominal" modifier="" oid="organism170" speaker="Yegorushka">The boy</mention> looked at his wet face with drops of water and big freckles which made it look like marble, and asked:

<quote connection="s3018" id="s5345" mention="organism170" oid="49" speaker="Yegorushka">"Shall we soon be going?"</quote>

<mention connection="s5346" entity="entity10" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s3019" mentiontype="name" oid="named187" speaker="Deniska">Deniska</mention> looked at the height of the sun and answered:

<quote connection="s3019" id="s5346" mention="named187" oid="50" speaker="Deniska">"I expect so."</quote>

He dried himself with the tail of his shirt and, making a very serious face, hopped on one leg.

<quote connection="s5379" id="s5347" mention="named187" oid="51" speaker="Deniska">"I say, which of us will get to the sedge first?"</quote> <mention connection="s5347" id="s5379" speaker="Deniska">he</mention> said.

<mention>Yegorushka</mention> was exhausted by the heat and drowsiness, but he raced off after him all the same. <mention>Deniska</mention> was in his twentieth year, was a coachman and going to be married, but he had not left off being a boy. He was very fond of flying kites, chasing pigeons, playing knuckle-bones, running races, and always took part in children's games and disputes. No sooner had his master turned his back or gone to sleep than <mention>Deniska</mention> would begin doing something such as hopping on one leg or throwing stones. It was hard for <mention connection="s5348" id="s5382" speaker="any_grown-up_person">any grown-up person</mention>, seeing the genuine enthusiasm with which he frolicked about in the society of <mention>children</mention>, to resist saying, <quote connection="s5382" id="s5348" oid="52" speaker="any_grown-up_person">"What a baby!"</quote> Children, on the other hand, saw nothing strange in the invasion of their domain by the big coachman. <quote connection="s5383" id="s5349" mention="organism175" oid="53" speaker="children">"Let him play,"</quote> <mention connection="s5349,s5350" id="s5383" speaker="children">they</mention> thought, <quote connection="s5383" id="s5350" mention="organism175" oid="54" speaker="children">"as long as he doesn't fight!"</quote> In the same way little dogs see nothing strange in it when a simple-hearted big dog joins their company uninvited and begins playing with them.

<mention>Deniska</mention> outstripped <mention>Yegorushka</mention>, and was evidently very much pleased at having done so. He winked at him, and to show that he could hop on one leg any distance, suggested to <mention>Yegorushka</mention> that he should hop with him along the road and from there, without resting, back to the chaise. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> declined this suggestion, for he was very much out of breath and exhausted.

All at once <mention>Deniska</mention> looked very grave, as he did not look even when Kuzmitchov gave him a scolding or threatened him with a stick; listening intently, he dropped quietly on one knee and an expression of sternness and alarm came into his face, such as one sees in people who hear heretical talk. He fixed his eyes on one spot, raised his hand curved into a hollow, and suddenly fell on his stomach on the ground and slapped the hollow of his hand down upon the grass.

<quote connection="s5380" id="s5351" mention="named198" oid="55" speaker="Deniska">"Caught!"</quote> <mention connection="s5351" id="s5380" speaker="Deniska">he</mention> wheezed triumphantly, and, getting up, lifted a big grasshopper to Yegorushka's eyes.

The two boys stroked the grasshopper's broad green back with their fingers and touched his antenna, supposing that this would please the creature. Then <mention>Deniska</mention> caught a fat fly that had been sucking blood and offered it to the grasshopper. The latter moved his huge jaws, that were like the visor of a helmet, with the utmost unconcern, as though he had been long acquainted with <mention>Deniska</mention>, and bit off the fly's stomach. They let him go. With a flash of the pink lining of his wings, he flew down into the grass and at once began his churring notes again. They let the fly go, too. It preened its wings, and without its stomach flew off to the horses.

A loud sigh was heard from under the chaise. It was Kuzmitchov waking up. He quickly raised his head, looked uneasily into the distance, and from that look, which passed by <mention>Yegorushka</mention> and <mention>Deniska</mention> without sympathy or interest, it could be seen that his thought on awaking was of the wool and of <mention>Varlamov</mention>.

<quote connection="s5372" id="s5352" mention="named203" oid="56" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"<mention>Father Christopher</mention>, get up; it is time to start,"</quote> <mention connection="s5352,s5353" id="s5372" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">he </mention>said anxiously. <quote connection="s5372" id="s5353" mention="named203" oid="57" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"Wake up; we've slept too long as it is! <mention>Deniska</mention>, put the horses in."</quote>

Father Christopher woke up with the same smile with which he had fallen asleep; his face looked creased and wrinkled from sleep, and seemed only half the size. After washing and dressing, he proceeded without haste to take out of his pocket a little greasy psalter; and standing with his face towards the east, began in a whisper repeating the psalms of the day and crossing himself.

<quote connection="s3058" id="s5354" mention="named210" oid="58" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"Father Christopher,"</quote> said <mention connection="s5354,s5355,s5358,s5360" entity="entity5" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s3058" mentiontype="name" oid="named210" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Kuzmitchov</mention> reproachfully, <quote connection="s3058" id="s5355" mention="named210" oid="59" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"it's time to start; the horses are ready, and here are you, . . . upon my word."</quote>

<quote connection="s3058" id="s5360" mention="named210" oid="64" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"God will overlook it."</quote>

For a full quarter of an hour <mention>Father Christopher</mention> stood facing the east and moving his lips, while Kuzmitchov looked at him almost with hatred and impatiently shrugged his shoulders. He was particularly irritated when, after every <quote connection="s3068" id="s5361" mention="named218" oid="65" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"Hallelujah,"</quote> <mention connection="s5361,s5362" entity="entity6" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s3068" mentiontype="name" oid="named218" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">Father Christopher</mention> drew a long breath, rapidly crossed himself and repeated three times, intentionally raising his voice so that the others might cross themselves, <quote connection="s3068" id="s5362" mention="named218" oid="66" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!

<quote connection="s5381" id="s5363" mention="named218" oid="67" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"Finis!"</quote>

A minute later the chaise had started on the road. As though it were going backwards and not forwards, the travellers saw the same scene as they had before midday.

The low hills were still plunged in the lilac distance, and no end could be seen to them. There were glimpses of high grass and heaps of stones; strips of stubble land passed by them and still the same rooks, the same hawk, moving its wings with slow dignity, moved over the steppe. The air was more sultry than ever; from the sultry heat and the stillness submissive nature was spellbound into silence . . . . No wind, no fresh cheering sound, no cloud.

But at last, when the sun was beginning to sink into the west, the steppe, the hills and the air could bear the oppression no longer, and, driven out of all patience, exhausted, tried to fling off the yoke. A fleecy ashen-grey cloud unexpectedly appeared behind the hills. <mention connection="s5364" id="s5384" speaker="a_fleecy_ashen-grey_cloud">It</mention> exchanged glances with the steppe, as though to say, <quote connection="s5384" id="s5364" oid="68" speaker="a_fleecy_ashen-grey_cloud">"Here I am,"</quote> and frowned. Suddenly something burst in the stagnant air; there was a violent squall of wind which whirled round and round, roaring and whistling over the steppe. At once a murmur rose from the grass and last year's dry herbage, the dust curled in spiral eddies over the road, raced over the steppe, and carrying with it straws, dragon flies and feathers, rose up in a whirling black column towards the sky and darkened the sun. Prickly uprooted plants ran stumbling and leaping in all directions over the steppe, and one of them got caught in the whirlwind, turned round and round like a bird, flew towards the sky, and turning into a little black speck, vanished from sight. After it flew another, and then a third, and <mention>Yegorushka</mention> saw two of them meet in the blue height and clutch at one another as though they were wrestling.

A bustard flew up by the very road. Fluttering his wings and his tail, he looked, bathed in the sunshine, like an angler's glittering tin fish or a waterfly flashing so swiftly over the water that its wings cannot be told from its antenna, which seem to be growing before, behind and on all sides. . . . Quivering in the air like an insect with a shimmer of bright colours, the bustard flew high up in a straight line, then, probably frightened by a cloud of dust, swerved to one side, and for a long time the gleam of his wings could be seen. . . .

Then a corncrake flew up from the grass, alarmed by the hurricane and not knowing what was the matter. It flew with the wind and not against it, like all the other birds, so that all its feathers were ruffled up and it was puffed out to the size of a hen and looked very angry and impressive. Only the rooks who had grown old on the steppe and were accustomed to its vagaries hovered calmly over the grass, or taking no notice of anything, went on unconcernedly pecking with their stout beaks at the hard earth.

There was a dull roll of thunder beyond the hills; there came a whiff of fresh air. <mention>Deniska</mention> gave a cheerful whistle and lashed his horses. <mention>Father Christopher</mention> and Kuzmitchov held their hats and looked intently towards the hills. . . . How pleasant a shower of rain would have been!

One effort, one struggle more, and it seemed the steppe would have got the upper hand. But the unseen oppressive force gradually riveted its fetters on the wind and the air, laid the dust, and the stillness came back again as though nothing had happened, the cloud hid, the sun-baked hills frowned submissively, the air grew calm, and only somewhere the troubled lapwings wailed and lamented their destiny. . . .

Soon after that the evening came on.</chapter><chapter>III

In the dusk of evening a big house of one storey, with a rusty iron roof and with dark windows, came into sight. This house was called a posting-inn, though it had nothing like a stableyard, and it stood in the middle of the steppe, with no kind of enclosure round it. A little to one side of it a wretched little cherry orchard shut in by a hurdle fence made a dark patch, and under the windows stood sleepy sunflowers drooping their heavy heads. From the orchard came the clatter of a little toy windmill, set there to frighten away hares by the rattle. Nothing more could be seen near the house, and nothing could be heard but the steppe. The chaise had scarcely stopped at the porch with an awning over it, when from the house there came <mention>the sound</mention> of cheerful voices, one a man's, another a woman's; there was the creak of a swing-door, and in a flash a tall gaunt figure, swinging its arms and fluttering its coat, was standing by the chaise. This was the innkeeper, Moisey Moisevitch, a man no longer young, with a very pale face and a handsome beard as black as charcoal. He was wearing a threadbare black coat, which hung flapping on his narrow shoulders as though on a hatstand, and fluttered its skirts like wings every time <mention>Moisey Moisevitch</mention> flung up his hands in delight or horror. Besides his coat <mention>the innkeeper</mention> was wearing full white trousers, not stuck into his boots, and a velvet waistcoat with brown flowers on it that looked like gigantic bugs.

<mention>Moisey Moisevitch</mention> was at first dumb with excess of feeling on recognizing the travellers, then he clasped his hands and uttered a moan. His coat swung its skirts, his back bent into a bow, and his pale face twisted into a smile that suggested that to see the chaise was not merely a pleasure to him, but actually a joy so sweet as to be painful.

<quote connection="s8216" id="s8089" mention="named229" oid="69" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">"Oh dear! oh dear!"</quote> <mention connection="s8089,s8090" id="s8216" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">he</mention> began in a thin sing-song voice, breathless, fussing about and preventing the travellers from getting out of the chaise by his antics. <quote connection="s8216" id="s8090" mention="named229" oid="70" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">"What a happy day for me! Oh, what am I to do now? <mention>Ivan Ivanitch</mention>! <mention>Father Christopher</mention>! What a pretty little gentleman sitting on the box, God strike me dead! Oh, my goodness! why am I standing here instead of asking the visitors indoors? Please walk in, I humbly beg you. . . . You are kindly welcome! Give me all your things. . . . Oh, my goodness me!"</quote>

<mention connection="s8091" entity="entity170" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s5846" mentiontype="name" oid="named236" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">Moisey Moisevitch</mention>, who was rummaging in the chaise and assisting the travellers to alight, suddenly turned back and shouted in <mention>a voice</mention> as frantic and choking as though he were drowning and calling for help:

<quote connection="s5846" id="s8091" mention="named236" oid="71" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">"Solomon! <mention>Solomon</mention>!"</quote>

<quote connection="s8217" id="s8092" oid="72" speaker="the_Jewess">"Solomon! <mention>Solomon</mention>!"</quote> <mention connection="s8092" id="s8217" speaker="the_Jewess">a woman's voice</mention> repeated indoors.

The swing-door creaked, and in the doorway appeared a rather short young Jew with a big beak-like nose, with a bald patch surrounded by rough red curly hair; he was dressed in a short and very shabby reefer jacket, with rounded lappets and short sleeves, and in short serge trousers, so that he looked skimpy and short-tailed like an unfledged bird. This was <mention>Solomon</mention>, the brother of <mention>Moisey Moisevitch</mention>. He went up to the chaise, smiling rather queerly, and did not speak or greet the travellers.

<quote connection="s5862" id="s8093" mention="named244" oid="73" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">"<mention>Ivan Ivanitch</mention> and <mention>Father Christopher</mention> have come,"</quote> said <mention connection="s8093,s8094" entity="entity170" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s5862" mentiontype="name" oid="named244" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">Moisey Moisevitch</mention> in a tone as though he were afraid his brother would not believe him. <quote connection="s5862" id="s8094" mention="named244" oid="74" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">"Dear, dear! What a surprise! Such honoured guests to have come us so suddenly! Come, take their things, Solomon. Walk in, honoured guests."</quote>

A little later Kuzmitchov, <mention>Father Christopher</mention>, and <mention>Yegorushka</mention> were sitting in a big gloomy empty room at an old oak table. The table was almost in solitude, for, except a wide sofa covered with torn American leather and three chairs, there was no other furniture in the room. And, indeed, not everybody would have given the chairs that name. They were a pitiful semblance of furniture, covered with American leather that had seen its best days, and with backs bent backwards at an unnaturally acute angle, so that they looked like children's sledges. It was hard to imagine what had been the unknown carpenter's object in bending the chairbacks so mercilessly, and one was tempted to imagine that it was not the carpenter's fault, but that some athletic visitor had bent the chairs like this as a feat, then had tried to bend them back again and had made them worse. The room looked gloomy, the walls were grey, the ceilings and the cornices were grimy; on the floor were chinks and yawning holes that were hard to account for (one might have fancied they were made by the heel of the same athlete), and it seemed as though the room would still have been dark if a dozen lamps had hung in it. There was nothing approaching an ornament on the walls or the windows. On one wall, however, there hung a list of regulations of some sort under a two-headed eagle in a grey wooden frame, and on another wall in the same sort of frame an engraving with the inscription, <quote connection="" id="s8095" oid="75" speaker="none">"The Indifference of Man."</quote> What it was to which men were indifferent it was impossible to make out, as the engraving was very dingy with age and was extensively flyblown. There was a smell of something decayed and sour in the room.

As he led the visitors into the room, <mention connection="s8097,s8099" entity="entity170" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s5880" mentiontype="name" oid="named252" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">Moisey Moisevitch</mention> went on wriggling, gesticulating, shrugging and uttering joyful exclamations; he considered these antics necessary in order to seem polite and agreeable.

<quote connection="s8238" id="s8096" mention="named253" oid="76" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"When did our waggons go by?"</quote> <mention connection="s8096" id="s8238" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Kuzmitchov</mention> asked.

<quote connection="s5893" id="s8104" mention="named263" oid="84" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">"A quarter of an hour!"</quote> squealed <mention connection="s8104,s8105" entity="entity170" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s5893" mentiontype="name" oid="named263" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">Moisey Moisevitch</mention>. <quote connection="s5893" id="s8105" mention="named263" oid="85" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">"Have you no fear of God, Ivan Ivanitch?

<quote connection="s8240" id="s8106" mention="named266" oid="86" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"We have no time for tea,"</quote> said <mention connection="s8106" id="s8240" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Kuzmitchov</mention>.

<mention>Moisey Moisevitch</mention> bent his head on one side, crooked his knees, and put his open hands before him as though warding off a blow, while with a smile of agonized sweetness <mention connection="s8107" id="s8218" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">he</mention> began imploring:

<quote connection="s8218" id="s8107" mention="named267" oid="87" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">"Ivan Ivanitch! <mention>Father Christopher</mention>! Do be so good as to take a cup of tea with me.

<quote connection="s5903" id="s8108" mention="named272" oid="88" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"Well, we may just as well have a cup of tea,"</quote> said <mention connection="s8108,s8109" entity="entity6" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s5903" mentiontype="name" oid="named272" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">Father Christopher</mention>, with a sympathetic smile; <quote connection="s5903" id="s8109" mention="named272" oid="89" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"that won't keep us long."</quote>

<quote connection="s5904" id="s8110" mention="named273" oid="90" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"Very well,"</quote> <mention connection="s8110" entity="entity5" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s5904" mentiontype="name" oid="named273" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Kuzmitchov</mention> assented.

<mention connection="s8111" entity="entity170" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s5905" mentiontype="name" oid="named274" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">Moisey Moisevitch</mention>, in a fluster uttered an exclamation of joy, and shrugging as though he had just stepped out of cold weather into warm, ran to the door and cried in the same frantic voice in which he had called <mention>Solomon</mention>:

<quote connection="s5905" id="s8111" mention="named274" oid="91" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">"Rosa! Rosa! Bring the samovar!"</quote>

A minute later the door opened, and <mention>Solomon</mention> came into the room carrying a large tray in his hands. Setting the tray on the table, he looked away sarcastically with the same queer smile as before. Now, by the light of the lamp, it was possible to see his smile distinctly; it was very complex, and expressed a variety of emotions, but the predominant element in it was undisguised contempt. He seemed to be thinking of something ludicrous and silly, to be feeling contempt and dislike, to be pleased at something and waiting for the favourable moment to turn something into ridicule and to burst into laughter. His long nose, his thick lips, and his sly prominent eyes seemed tense with the desire to laugh. Looking at his face, <mention connection="s8112" entity="entity5" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s5912" mentiontype="name" oid="named278" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Kuzmitchov</mention> smiled ironically and asked:

<quote connection="s5912" id="s8112" mention="named278" oid="92" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"Solomon, why did you not come to our fair at N. this summer, and act some Jewish scenes?"</quote>

Two years before, as <mention>Yegorushka</mention> remembered very well, at one of the booths at the fair at N., <mention>Solomon</mention> had performed some scenes of Jewish life, and his acting had been a great success. The allusion to this made no impression whatever upon <mention>Solomon</mention>. Making no answer, he went out and returned a little later with the samovar.

When he had done what he had to do at the table he moved a little aside, and, folding his arms over his chest and thrusting out one leg, fixed his sarcastic eyes on <mention>Father Christopher</mention>. There was something defiant, haughty, and contemptuous in his attitude, and at the same time it was comic and pitiful in the extreme, because the more impressive his attitude the more vividly it showed up his short trousers, his bobtail coat, his caricature of a nose, and his bird-like plucked-looking little figure.

<mention>Moisey Moisevitch</mention> brought a footstool from the other room and sat down a little way from the table.

<quote connection="s8220" id="s8113" mention="named287" oid="93" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">"I wish you a good appetite! Tea and sugar!"</quote> <mention connection="s8113" id="s8220" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">he</mention> began, trying to entertain his visitors. <quote connection="s8221" id="s8114" mention="named287" oid="94" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">"I hope you will enjoy it. Such rare guests, such rare ones; it is years since I last saw <mention>Father Christopher</mention>. And will no one tell me who is this nice little gentleman?"</quote> <mention connection="s8114,s8116" id="s8221" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">he</mention> asked, looking tenderly at <mention>Yegorushka</mention>.

<quote connection="s5931" id="s8115" mention="named294" oid="95" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"He is the son of my sister, Olga Ivanovna,"</quote> answered <mention connection="s8115,s8117" entity="entity5" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s5931" mentiontype="name" oid="named294" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Kuzmitchov</mention>.

<quote connection="s8221" id="s8116" oid="96" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">"And where is he going?"</quote>

<quote connection="s5931" id="s8117" mention="named294" oid="97" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"To school. We are taking him to a high school."</quote>

In his politeness, <mention>Moisey Moisevitch</mention> put on a look of wonder and wagged his head expressively.

<quote connection="s8222" id="s8118" mention="named295" oid="98" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">"Ah, that is a fine thing,"</quote> <mention connection="s8118,s8119" id="s8222" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">he</mention> said, shaking his finger at the samovar. <quote connection="s8222" id="s8119" mention="named295" oid="99" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">"That's a fine thing.

<mention connection="s8120,s8125,s8246" id="s8223" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">He</mention> paused a little, stroked his knees, and began again in a jocose and deferential tone.

<quote connection="s8223" id="s8120" mention="named295" oid="100" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">"You must excuse me, Father Christopher, but I am thinking of writing to the bishop to tell him you are robbing the merchants of their living. I shall take a sheet of stamped paper and write that I suppose <mention>Father Christopher</mention> is short of pence, as he has taken up with trade and begun selling wool."</quote>

<quote connection="s5941" id="s8121" mention="named301" oid="101" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"H'm, yes . . . it's a queer notion in my old age,"</quote> said <mention connection="s8121,s8122,s8124,s8126" entity="entity6" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s5941" mentiontype="name" oid="named301" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">Father Christopher</mention>, and he laughed. <quote connection="s5941" id="s8122" mention="named301" oid="102" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"I have turned from priest to merchant, brother.

<quote connection="s8223" id="s8125" mention="named295" oid="105" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">"Why doesn't he go himself?"</quote>

<quote connection="s5941" id="s8126" mention="named301" oid="106" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"Why, because . . . His mother's milk is scarcely dry upon his lips.

Father Christopher suddenly thought of something, spluttered into his glass and choked with laughter. <mention>Moisey Moisevitch</mention> laughed, too, from politeness, and he, too, cleared his throat.

Moisey Moisevitch got up, too, and with his hands on his stomach, went off into shrill laughter like the yap of a lap-dog.

He laughed and talked, though at the same time he was casting timorous and suspicious looks at <mention>Solomon</mention>. The latter was standing in the same attitude and still smiling. To judge from his eyes and his smile, his contempt and hatred were genuine, but that was so out of keeping with his plucked-looking figure that it seemed to <mention>Yegorushka</mention> as though he were putting on his defiant attitude and biting sarcastic smile to play the fool for the entertainment of their honoured guests.

After drinking six glasses of tea in silence, Kuzmitchov cleared a space before him on the table, took his bag, the one which he kept under his head when he slept under the chaise, untied the string and shook it. Rolls of paper notes were scattered out of the bag on the table.

<quote connection="s6018" id="s8147" mention="named356" oid="120" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"While we have the time, Father Christopher, let us reckon up,"</quote> said <mention connection="s8147,s8149" entity="entity5" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s6018" mentiontype="name" oid="named356" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Kuzmitchov</mention>.

<mention>Moisey Moisevitch</mention> was embarrassed at the sight of the money. He got up, and, as a man of delicate feeling unwilling to pry into other people's secrets, he went out of the room on tiptoe, swaying his arms. <mention>Solomon</mention> remained where he was.

Yegorushka had never in his life seen so much money as was lying on the table before him. There must have been a great deal of money, for the roll of seven thousand eight hundred, which <mention>Father Christopher</mention> put aside for <mention>Varlamov</mention>, seemed very small compared with the whole heap. At any other time such a mass of money would have impressed <mention>Yegorushka</mention>, and would have moved him to reflect how many cracknels, buns and poppy-cakes could be bought for that money. Now he looked at it listlessly, only conscious of the disgusting smell of kerosene and rotten apples that came from the heap of notes. He was exhausted by the jolting ride in the chaise, tired out and sleepy. His head was heavy, his eyes would hardly keep open and his thoughts were tangled like threads. If it had been possible he would have been relieved to lay his head on the table, so as not to see the lamp and the fingers moving over the heaps of notes, and to have let his tired sleepy thoughts go still more at random. When he tried to keep awake, the light of the lamp, the cups and the fingers grew double, the samovar heaved and the smell of rotten apples seemed even more acrid and disgusting.

Moisey Moisevitch came in on tiptoe. Trying from delicacy not to look at the heaps of money, he stole up to <mention>Yegorushka</mention> and pulled at his shirt from behind.

<quote connection="s8226" id="s8156" mention="named378" oid="129" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">"Come along, little gentleman,"</quote> <mention connection="s8156,s8157" id="s8226" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">he</mention> said in an undertone, <quote connection="s8226" id="s8157" mention="named378" oid="130" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">"come and see the little bear I can show you! Such a queer, cross little bear. Oo-oo!"</quote>

The sleepy boy got up and listlessly dragged himself after <mention>Moisey Moisevitch</mention> to see the bear. He went into a little room, where, before he saw anything, he felt he could not breathe from the smell of something sour and decaying, which was much stronger here than in the big room and probably spread from this room all over the house. One part of the room was occupied by a big bed, covered with a greasy quilt and another by a chest of drawers and heaps of rags of all kinds from a woman's stiff petticoat to children's little breeches and braces. A tallow candle stood on the chest of drawers.

Instead of the promised bear, <mention>Yegorushka</mention> saw a big fat Jewess with her hair hanging loose, in a red flannel skirt with black sprigs on it; she turned with difficulty in the narrow space between the bed and the chest of drawers and uttered drawn-out moaning as though she had toothache. On seeing <mention>Yegorushka</mention>, she made a doleful, woe-begone face, heaved a long drawn-out sigh, and before he had time to look round, put to his lips a slice of bread smeared with honey.

<quote connection="s8227" id="s8158" mention="organism287" oid="131" speaker="the_Jewess">"Eat it, dearie, eat it!"</quote> <mention connection="s8158,s8159" id="s8227" speaker="the_Jewess">she</mention> said. <quote connection="s8227" id="s8159" mention="organism287" oid="132" speaker="the_Jewess">"You are here without your mamma, and no one to look after you.

Yegorushka did eat it, though after the goodies and poppy-cakes he had every day at home, he did not think very much of the honey, which was mixed with wax and bees' wings. He ate while <mention>Moisey Moisevitch</mention> and <mention>the Jewess</mention> looked at him and sighed.

<quote connection="s6063" id="s8160" mention="organism292" oid="133" speaker="the_Jewess">"Where are you going, dearie?"</quote> asked <mention class="Jewess" connection="s8160,s8162" entity="organism292" entitytype="PERSON" gender="plural" id="s6063" mentiontype="nominal" modifier="" oid="organism292" speaker="the_Jewess">the Jewess</mention>.

The greasy quilt quivered, and from beneath it appeared a child's curly head on a very thin neck; two black eyes gleamed and stared with curiosity at <mention>Yegorushka</mention>. Still sighing, <mention>Moisey Moisevitch</mention> and <mention>the Jewess</mention> went to the chest of drawers and began talking in Yiddish. <mention connection="s8168" entity="entity170" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s6078" mentiontype="name" oid="named393" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">Moisey Moisevitch</mention> spoke in a low bass undertone, and altogether his talk in Yiddish was like a continual <quote connection="s6078" id="s8168" mention="named393" oid="141" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">"ghaal-ghaal-ghaal-ghaal, . . ."</quote> while <mention connection="s8169" id="s8228" speaker="the_Jewess">his wife</mention> answered him in a shrill voice like a turkeycock's, and the whole effect of her talk was something like <quote connection="s8228" id="s8169" oid="142" speaker="the_Jewess">"Too-too-too-too!"</quote> While they were consulting, another little curly head on a thin neck peeped out of the greasy quilt, then a third, then a fourth. . . . If <mention>Yegorushka</mention> had had a fertile imagination he might have imagined that the hundred-headed hydra was hiding under the quilt.

<quote connection="s6083" id="s8170" mention="named396" oid="143" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">"Ghaal-ghaal-ghaal-ghaal!"</quote> said <mention connection="s8170" entity="entity170" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s6083" mentiontype="name" oid="named396" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">Moisey Moisevitch</mention>.

<quote connection="s8229" id="s8171" oid="144" speaker="the_Jewess">"Too-too-too-too!"</quote> answered <mention connection="s8171" id="s8229" speaker="the_Jewess">the Jewess</mention>.

The consultation ended in the Jewess's diving with a deep sigh into the chest of drawers, and, unwrapping some sort of green rag there, she took out a big rye cake made in the shape of a heart.

<quote connection="s8230" id="s8172" mention="organism303" oid="145" speaker="the_Jewess">"Take it, dearie,"</quote> <mention connection="s8172,s8173" id="s8230" speaker="the_Jewess">she</mention> said, giving <mention>Yegorushka</mention> the cake; <quote connection="s8230" id="s8173" mention="organism303" oid="146" speaker="the_Jewess">"you have no mamma now-- no one to give you nice things."</quote>

Yegorushka stuck the cake in his pocket and staggered to the door, as he could not go on breathing the foul, sour air in which <mention>the innkeeper</mention> and his wife lived. Going back to the big room, he settled himself more comfortably on the sofa and gave up trying to check his straying thoughts.

As soon as Kuzmitchov had finished counting out the notes he put them back into the bag. He did not treat them very respectfully and stuffed them into the dirty sack without ceremony, as indifferently as though they had not been money but waste paper.

<mention>Father Christopher</mention> was talking to <mention>Solomon</mention>.

<quote connection="s8231" id="s8174" mention="named400" oid="147" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"Well, <mention>Solomon</mention> the Wise!"</quote> <mention connection="s8174,s8175,s8177,s8180" id="s8231" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">he</mention> said, yawning and making the sign of the cross over his mouth. <quote connection="s8231" id="s8175" mention="named400" oid="148" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"How is business?"</quote>

<quote connection="s6096" id="s8176" mention="named403" oid="149" speaker="Solomon">"What sort of business are you talking about?"</quote> asked <mention connection="s8176" entity="entity176" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s6096" mentiontype="name" oid="named403" speaker="Solomon">Solomon</mention>, and he looked as fiendish, as though it were a hint of some crime on his part.

<quote connection="s8231" id="s8177" mention="named400" oid="150" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"Oh, things in general. What are you doing?"</quote>

<quote connection="s8231" id="s8180" mention="named400" oid="153" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"Why would he be your servant?"</quote>

<quote connection="s6098" id="s8181" mention="named406" oid="154" speaker="Solomon">"Why, because there isn't a gentleman or millionaire who isn't ready to lick the hand of a scabby Jew for the sake of making a kopeck. Now, I am a scabby Jew and a beggar. Everybody looks at me as though I were a dog, but if I had money <mention>Varlamov</mention> would play the fool before me just as Moisey does before you."</quote>

Father Christopher and Kuzmitchov looked at each other. Neither of them understood <mention>Solomon</mention>. <mention connection="s8182" entity="entity5" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s6125" mentiontype="name" oid="named418" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Kuzmitchov</mention> looked at him sternly and dryly, and asked:

<quote connection="s6125" id="s8182" mention="named418" oid="155" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"How can you compare yourself with <mention>Varlamov</mention>, you blockhead?"</quote>

<quote connection="s6130" id="s8183" mention="named424" oid="156" speaker="Solomon">"I am not such a fool as to put myself on a level with <mention>Varlamov</mention>,"</quote> answered <mention connection="s8183,s8184" entity="entity176" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s6130" mentiontype="name" oid="named424" speaker="Solomon">Solomon</mention>, looking sarcastically at the speaker. <quote connection="s6130" id="s8184" mention="named424" oid="157" speaker="Solomon">"Though <mention>Varlamov</mention> is a Russian, he is at heart a scabby Jew; money and gain are all he lives for, but I threw my money in the stove!

A little later Yegorushka, half asleep, heard <mention>Solomon</mention> in a hoarse hollow voice choked with hatred, in hurried stuttering phrases, talking about the Jews. At first he talked correctly in Russian, then he fell into the tone of a Jewish recitation, and began speaking as he had done at the fair with an exaggerated Jewish accent.

Moisey Moisevitch came in. He looked anxiously at <mention>Solomon</mention> and at his visitors, and again the skin on his face quivered nervously. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> shook his head and looked about him; he caught a passing glimpse of Solomon's face at the very moment when it was turned three-quarters towards him and when the shadow of his long nose divided his left cheek in half; the contemptuous smile mingled with that shadow; the gleaming sarcastic eyes, the haughty expression, and the whole plucked-looking little figure, dancing and doubling itself before Yegorushka's eyes, made him now not like a buffoon, but like something one sometimes dreams of, like an evil spirit.

<quote connection="s6165" id="s8192" mention="named445" oid="164" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"What a ferocious fellow you've got here, Moisey Moisevitch!

Kuzmitchov frowned angrily. <mention>Moisey Moisevitch</mention> looked uneasily and inquiringly at his brother and the visitors again.

Ten minutes passed and <mention connection="s8203" entity="entity170" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s6192" mentiontype="name" oid="named466" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">Moisey Moisevitch</mention> was still muttering in an undertone and sighing:

<quote connection="s6192" id="s8203" mention="named466" oid="175" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">"He does not sleep at night, and is always thinking and thinking and thinking, and what he is thinking about God only knows. If you go to him at night he is angry and laughs. He doesn't like me either . . . . And there is nothing he wants! When our father died he left us each six thousand roubles. I bought myself an inn, married, and now I have <mention>children</mention>; and he burnt all his money in the stove. Such a pity, such a pity! Why burn it? If he didn't want it he could give it to me, but why burn it?"</quote>

Suddenly the swing-door creaked and the floor shook under footsteps. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> felt a draught of cold air, and it seemed to him as though some big black bird had passed by him and had fluttered its wings close in his face. He opened his eyes. . . . His uncle was standing by the sofa with his sack in his hands ready for departure; <mention>Father Christopher</mention>, holding his broad-brimmed top-hat, was bowing to <mention>someone</mention> and smiling-- not his usual soft kindly smile, but a respectful forced smile which did not suit his face at all-- while <mention>Moisey Moisevitch</mention> looked as though his body had been broken into three parts, and he were balancing and doing his utmost not to drop to pieces. Only Solomon stood in the corner with his arms folded, as though nothing had happened, and smiled contemptuously as before.

<quote connection="s6202" id="s8204" mention="named475" oid="176" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">"Your Excellency must excuse us for not being tidy,"</quote> moaned <mention connection="s8204,s8205" entity="entity170" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s6202" mentiontype="name" oid="named475" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">Moisey Moisevitch</mention> with the agonizingly sweet smile, taking no more notice of Kuzmitchov or <mention>Father Christopher</mention>, but swaying his whole person so as to avoid dropping to pieces. <quote connection="s6202" id="s8205" mention="named475" oid="177" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">"We are plain folks, your Excellency."</quote>

Yegorushka rubbed his eyes. In the middle of the room there really was standing an Excellency, in the form of a young plump and very beautiful woman in a black dress and a straw hat. Before <mention>Yegorushka</mention> had time to examine her features the image of the solitary graceful poplar he had seen that day on the hill for some reason came into his mind.

<quote connection="s6212" id="s8206" mention="organism347" oid="178" speaker="Countess_Dranitsky">"Has Varlamov been here to-day?"</quote> <mention class="voice" connection="s8206,s8208" entity="organism347" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s6212" mentiontype="nominal" modifier="" oid="organism347" speaker="Countess_Dranitsky">a woman's voice</mention> inquired.

<quote connection="s6213" id="s8207" mention="named480" oid="179" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">"No, your Excellency,"</quote> said <mention connection="s8207" entity="entity170" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s6213" mentiontype="name" oid="named480" speaker="Moisey_Moisevitch">Moisey Moisevitch</mention>.

<quote connection="s6212" id="s8208" mention="organism347" oid="180" speaker="Countess_Dranitsky">"If you see him to-morrow, ask him to come and see me for a minute."</quote>

All at once, quite unexpectedly, <mention>Yegorushka</mention> saw half an inch from his eyes velvety black eyebrows, big brown eyes, delicate feminine cheeks with dimples, from which smiles seemed radiating all over the face like sunbeams. There was a glorious scent.

<quote connection="s6215" id="s8209" mention="organism348" oid="181" speaker="Countess_Dranitsky">"What a pretty boy!"</quote> said <mention class="lady" connection="s8209,s8210" entity="organism348" entitytype="PERSON" gender="female" id="s6215" mentiontype="nominal" modifier="" oid="organism348" speaker="Countess_Dranitsky">the lady</mention>. <quote connection="s6215" id="s8210" mention="organism348" oid="182" speaker="Countess_Dranitsky">"Whose boy is it? Kazimir Mihalovitch, look what a charming fellow! Good heavens, he is asleep!"</quote>

And <mention>the lady</mention> kissed <mention>Yegorushka</mention> warmly on both cheeks, and he smiled and, thinking he was asleep, shut his eyes. The swing-door squeaked, and there was <mention>the sound</mention> of hurried footsteps, coming in and going out.

<quote connection="s8245" id="s8211" mention="organism350" oid="183" speaker="two_bass_voices">"Yegorushka, Yegorushka!"</quote> he heard <mention connection="s8211,s8212" id="s8245" speaker="two_bass_voices">two bass voices</mention> whisper. <quote connection="s8245" id="s8212" mention="organism350" oid="184" speaker="two_bass_voices">"Get up; it is time to start."</quote>

Somebody, it seemed to be <mention>Deniska</mention>, set him on his feet and led him by the arm. On the way he half-opened his eyes and once more saw the beautiful lady in the black dress who had kissed him. She was standing in the middle of the room and watched him go out, smiling at him and nodding her head in a friendly way. As he got near the door he saw a handsome, stoutly built, dark man in a bowler hat and in leather gaiters. This must have been the lady's escort.

<quote connection="" id="s8213" oid="185" speaker="none">"Woa!"</quote> he heard from the yard.

At the front door <mention>Yegorushka</mention> saw a splendid new carriage and a pair of black horses. On the box sat a groom in livery, with a long whip in his hands. No one but <mention>Solomon</mention> came to see the travellers off. His face was tense with a desire to laugh; he looked as though he were waiting impatiently for the visitors to be gone, so that he might laugh at them without restraint.

<quote connection="s6233" id="s8214" mention="named489" oid="186" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"The Countess Dranitsky,"</quote> whispered <mention connection="s8214" entity="entity6" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s6233" mentiontype="name" oid="named489" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">Father Christopher</mention>, clambering into the chaise.

<quote connection="s6235" id="s8215" mention="named492" oid="187" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"Yes, Countess Dranitsky,"</quote> repeated <mention connection="s8215" entity="entity5" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s6235" mentiontype="name" oid="named492" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Kuzmitchov</mention>, also in a whisper.

The impression made by the arrival of the countess was probably very great, for even Deniska spoke in a whisper, and only ventured to lash his bays and shout when the chaise had driven a quarter of a mile away and nothing could be seen of the inn but a dim light.</chapter><chapter>IV

Who was this elusive, mysterious Varlamov of whom people talked so much, whom <mention>Solomon</mention> despised, and whom even the beautiful countess needed? Sitting on the box beside <mention>Deniska</mention>, <mention>Yegorushka</mention>, half asleep, thought about this person. He had never seen him. But he had often heard of him and pictured him in his imagination. He knew that <mention>Varlamov</mention> possessed several tens of thousands of acres of land, about a hundred thousand sheep, and a great deal of money. Of his manner of life and occupation <mention>Yegorushka</mention> knew nothing, except that he was always <quote connection="" id="s11077" oid="188" speaker="none">"going his rounds in these parts,"</quote> and he was always being looked for.

At home <mention>Yegorushka</mention> had heard a great deal of the Countess Dranitsky, too. She, too, had some tens of thousands of acres, a great many sheep, a stud farm and a great deal of money, but she did not <quote connection="" id="s11078" oid="189" speaker="none">"go rounds,"</quote> but lived at home in a splendid house and grounds, about which <mention>Ivan Ivanitch</mention>, who had been more than once at the countess's on business, and other acquaintances told many marvellous tales; thus, for instance, they said that in the countess's drawing-room, where the portraits of all the kings of Poland hung on the walls, there was a big table-clock in the form of a rock, on the rock a gold horse with diamond eyes, rearing, and on the horse the figure of a rider also of gold, who brandished his sword to right and to left whenever the clock struck. They said, too, that twice a year the countess used to give a ball, to which the gentry and officials of the whole province were invited, and to which even Varlamov used to come; all the visitors drank tea from silver samovars, ate all sorts of extraordinary things (they had strawberries and raspberries, for instance, in winter at Christmas), and danced to a band which played day and night. . . .

<quote connection="s9127" id="s11079" mention="named505" oid="190" speaker="Yegorushka">"And how beautiful she is,"</quote> thought <mention connection="s11079" entity="entity11" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s9127" mentiontype="name" oid="named505" speaker="Yegorushka">Yegorushka</mention>, remembering her face and smile.

<mention connection="s11080" entity="entity5" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s9128" mentiontype="name" oid="named506" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Kuzmitchov</mention>, too, was probably thinking about the countess. For when the chaise had driven a mile and a half he said:

<quote connection="s9128" id="s11080" mention="named506" oid="191" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"But doesn't that Kazimir Mihalovitch plunder her right and left! The year before last when, do you remember, I bought some wool from her, he made over three thousand from my purchase alone."</quote>

<quote connection="s9132" id="s11081" mention="named509" oid="192" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"That is just what you would expect from a Pole,"</quote> said <mention connection="s11081,s11082" entity="entity6" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s9132" mentiontype="name" oid="named509" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">Father Christopher</mention>.

<quote connection="s9132" id="s11082" mention="named509" oid="193" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"And little does it trouble her. Young and foolish, as they say, her head is full of nonsense."</quote>

Yegorushka, for some reason, longed to think of nothing but <mention>Varlamov</mention> and the countess, particularly the latter. His drowsy brain utterly refused ordinary thoughts, was in a cloud and retained only fantastic fairy-tale images, which have the advantage of springing into the brain of themselves without any effort on the part of the thinker, and completely vanishing of themselves at a mere shake of the head; and, indeed, nothing that was around him disposed to ordinary thoughts. On the right there were the dark hills which seemed to be screening something unseen and terrible; on the left the whole sky about the horizon was covered with a crimson glow, and it was hard to tell whether there was a fire somewhere, or whether it was the moon about to rise. As by day the distance could be seen, but its tender lilac tint had gone, quenched by the evening darkness, in which the whole steppe was hidden like Moisey Moisevitch's children under the quilt.

Corncrakes and quails do not call in the July nights, the nightingale does not sing in the woodland marsh, and there is no scent of flowers, but still the steppe is lovely and full of life. As soon as the sun goes down and the darkness enfolds the earth, the day's weariness is forgotten, everything is forgiven, and the steppe breathes a light sigh from its broad bosom. As though because the grass cannot see in the dark that it has grown old, a gay youthful twitter rises up from it, such as is not heard by day; chirruping, twittering, whistling, scratching, the basses, tenors and sopranos of the steppe all mingle in an incessant, monotonous roar of sound in which it is sweet to brood on memories and sorrows. The monotonous twitter soothes to sleep like a lullaby; you drive and feel you are falling asleep, but suddenly there comes the abrupt agitated cry of a wakeful bird, or a vague sound like <mention class="voice" connection="s11083" entity="organism388" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s9149" mentiontype="nominal" modifier="" oid="organism388" speaker="a_voice">a voice</mention> crying out in wonder <quote connection="s9149" id="s11083" mention="organism388" oid="194" speaker="a_voice">"A-ah, a-ah!"</quote> and slumber closes one's eyelids again. Or you drive by a little creek where there are bushes and hear <mention class="bird" connection="s11085" entity="organism389" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s9150" mentiontype="nominal" modifier="" oid="organism389" speaker="the_bird">the bird</mention>, called by <mention connection="s11084" id="s11163" speaker="the_steppe_dwellers">the steppe dwellers</mention> <quote connection="s11163" id="s11084" oid="195" speaker="the_steppe_dwellers">"the sleeper,"</quote> call <quote connection="s9150" id="s11085" mention="organism389" oid="196" speaker="the_bird">"Asleep, asleep, asleep!"</quote> while another laughs or breaks into trills of hysterical weeping-- that is the owl. For whom do they call and who hears them on that plain, God only knows, but there is deep sadness and lamentation in their cry. . . . There is a scent of hay and dry grass and belated flowers, but the scent is heavy, sweetly mawkish and soft.

Everything can be seen through the mist, but it is hard to make out the colours and the outlines of objects. Everything looks different from what it is. You drive on and suddenly see standing before you right in the roadway a dark figure like a monk; it stands motionless, waiting, holding something in its hands. . . . Can it be a robber? The figure comes closer, grows bigger; now it is on a level with the chaise, and you see it is not a man, but a solitary bush or a great stone. Such motionless expectant figures stand on the low hills, hide behind the old barrows, peep out from the high grass, and they all look like human beings and arouse suspicion.

And when the moon rises the night becomes pale and dim. The mist seems to have passed away. The air is transparent, fresh and warm; one can see well in all directions and even distinguish the separate stalks of grass by the wayside. Stones and bits of pots can be seen at a long distance. The suspicious figures like monks look blacker against the light background of the night, and seem more sinister. More and more often in the midst of the monotonous chirruping there comes <mention connection="s11086" id="s11165" speaker="the_sound">the sound</mention> of the <quote connection="s11165" id="s11086" oid="197" speaker="the_sound">"A-ah, a-ah!"</quote> of astonishment troubling the motionless air, and the cry of a sleepless or delirious bird. Broad shadows move across the plain like clouds across the sky, and in the inconceivable distance, if you look long and intently at it, misty monstrous shapes rise up and huddle one against another. . . . It is rather uncanny. One glances at the pale green, star-spangled sky on which there is no cloudlet, no spot, and understands why the warm air is motionless, why nature is on her guard, afraid to stir: she is afraid and reluctant to lose one instant of life. Of the unfathomable depth and infinity of the sky one can only form a conception at sea and on the steppe by night when the moon is shining. It is terribly lonely and caressing; it looks down languid and alluring, and its caressing sweetness makes one giddy.

You drive on for one hour, for a second. . . . You meet upon the way a silent old barrow or a stone figure put up God knows when and by whom; a nightbird floats noiselessly over the earth, and little by little those legends of the steppes, the tales of men you have met, the stories of some old nurse from the steppe, and all the things you have managed to see and treasure in your soul, come back to your mind. And then in the churring of insects, in the sinister figures, in the ancient barrows, in the blue sky, in the moonlight, in the flight of the nightbird, in everything you see and hear, triumphant beauty, youth, the fulness of power, and the passionate thirst for life begin to be apparent; the soul responds to the call of her lovely austere fatherland, and longs to fly over the steppes with the nightbird. And in the triumph of beauty, in the exuberance of happiness you are conscious of yearning and grief, as though the steppe knew she was solitary, knew that her wealth and her inspiration were wasted for the world, not glorified in song, not wanted by <mention>anyone</mention>; and through the joyful clamour one hears her mournful, hopeless call for singers, singers!

<quote connection="s11160" id="s11087" oid="198" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"Woa! Good-evening, <mention connection="s11088" id="s11161" speaker="Panteley">Panteley</mention>! Is everything all right?"</quote>

<quote connection="s11161" id="s11088" oid="199" speaker="Panteley">"First-rate, <mention connection="s11087,s11089" id="s11160" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Ivan Ivanitch</mention>!  Haven't you seen <mention>Varlamov</mention>, lads?"</quote>

<quote connection="s11160" id="s11089" oid="200" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"No, we haven't."</quote>

Yegorushka woke up and opened his eyes. The chaise had stopped. On the right the train of waggons stretched for a long way ahead on the road, and men were moving to and fro near them. All the waggons being loaded up with great bales of wool looked very high and fat, while the horses looked short-legged and little.

<quote connection="s9185" id="s11090" mention="named524" oid="201" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"Well, then, we shall go on to the Molokans'!"</quote> <mention connection="s11090,s11091" entity="entity5" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s9185" mentiontype="name" oid="named524" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Kuzmitchov</mention> said aloud. <quote connection="s9185" id="s11091" mention="named524" oid="202" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"The Jew told us that <mention>Varlamov</mention> was putting up for the night at the Molokans'.

<quote connection="s9191" id="s11093" mention="named527" oid="204" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"I say, lads,"</quote> <mention connection="s11093,s11094" entity="entity5" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s9191" mentiontype="name" oid="named527" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Kuzmitchov</mention> cried briskly, <quote connection="s9191" id="s11094" mention="named527" oid="205" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"you take my little lad along with you!

Go on; it's all right. . . ."</quote>

Yegorushka got down from the box-seat. Several hands caught him, lifted him high into the air, and he found himself on something big, soft, and rather wet with dew. It seemed to him now as though the sky were quite close and the earth far away.

<quote connection="s9196" id="s11095" mention="named532" oid="206" speaker="Deniska">"Hey, take his little coat!"</quote> <mention connection="s11095" entity="entity10" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s9196" mentiontype="name" oid="named532" speaker="Deniska">Deniska</mention> shouted from somewhere far below.

His coat and bundle flung up from far below fell close to <mention>Yegorushka</mention>. Anxious not to think of anything, he quickly put his bundle under his head and covered himself with his coat, and stretching his legs out and shrinking a little from the dew, he laughed with content.

<quote connection="s11157" id="s11096" mention="named532" oid="207" speaker="Yegorushka">"Sleep, sleep, sleep, . . ."</quote> <mention connection="s11096" id="s11157" speaker="Yegorushka">he</mention> thought.

<quote connection="s9198" id="s11097" mention="organism418" oid="208" speaker="Deniska">"Don't be unkind to him, you devils!"</quote> he heard <mention class="voice" connection="s11097,s11100" entity="organism418" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s9198" mentiontype="nominal" modifier="" oid="organism418" speaker="Deniska">Deniska's voice</mention> below.

<quote connection="s11162" id="s11098" mention="named535" oid="209" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"Good-bye, lads; good luck to you,"</quote> shouted <mention connection="s11098,s11099" id="s11162" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Kuzmitchov</mention>. <quote connection="s11162" id="s11099" mention="named535" oid="210" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"I rely upon you!"</quote>

<quote connection="s9198" id="s11100" mention="named535" oid="211" speaker="Deniska">"Don't you be uneasy, Ivan Ivanitch!"</quote>

Deniska shouted to the horses, the chaise creaked and started, not along the road, but somewhere off to the side. For two minutes there was silence, as though the waggons were asleep and there was no sound except the clanking of the pails tied on at the back of the chaise as it slowly died away in the distance. Then <mention connection="s11101" id="s11164" speaker="someone">someone</mention> at the head of the waggons shouted:

<quote connection="s11164" id="s11101" oid="212" speaker="someone">"Kiruha! Sta-art!"</quote>

The foremost of the waggons creaked, then the second, then the third. . . . <mention>Yegorushka</mention> felt the waggon he was on sway and creak also. The waggons were moving. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> took a tighter hold of the cord with which the bales were tied on, laughed again with content, shifted the cake in his pocket, and fell asleep just as he did in his bed at home. . . .

When he woke up the sun had risen, it was screened by an ancient barrow, and, trying to shed its light upon the earth, it scattered its beams in all directions and flooded the horizon with gold. It seemed to <mention>Yegorushka</mention> that it was not in its proper place, as the day before it had risen behind his back, and now it was much more to his left. . . . And the whole landscape was different. There were no hills now, but on all sides, wherever one looked, there stretched the brown cheerless plain; here and there upon it small barrows rose up and rooks flew as they had done the day before. The belfries and huts of some village showed white in the distance ahead; as it was Sunday the Little Russians were at home baking and cooking-- that could be seen by the smoke which rose from every chimney and hung, a dark blue transparent veil, over the village. In between the huts and beyond the church there were blue glimpses of a river, and beyond the river a misty distance. But nothing was so different from yesterday as the road. Something extraordinarily broad, spread out and titanic, stretched over the steppe by way of a road. It was a grey streak well trodden down and covered with dust, like all roads. Its width puzzled <mention>Yegorushka</mention> and brought thoughts of fairy tales to his mind. Who travelled along that road? Who needed so much space? It was strange and unintelligible. It might have been supposed that giants with immense strides, such as Ilya Muromets and Solovy the Brigand, were still surviving in Russia, and that their gigantic steeds were still alive. Yegorushka, looking at the road, imagined some half a dozen high chariots racing along side by side, like some he used to see in pictures in his Scripture history; these chariots were each drawn by six wild furious horses, and their great wheels raised a cloud of dust to the sky, while the horses were driven by men such as one may see in one's dreams or in imagination brooding over fairy tales. And if those figures had existed, how perfectly in keeping with the steppe and the road they would have been!

Telegraph-poles with two wires on them stretched along the right side of the road to its furthermost limit. Growing smaller and smaller they disappeared near the village behind the huts and green trees, and then again came into sight in the lilac distance in the form of very small thin sticks that looked like pencils stuck into the ground. Hawks, falcons, and crows sat on the wires and looked indifferently at the moving waggons.

<mention>Yegorushka</mention> was lying in the last of the waggons, and so could see the whole string. There were about twenty waggons, and there was a driver to every three waggons. By the last waggon, the one in which <mention>Yegorushka</mention> was, there walked <mention>an old man</mention> with a grey beard, as short and lean as <mention>Father Christopher</mention>, but with a sunburnt, stern and brooding face. It is very possible that the old man was not stern and not brooding, but his red eyelids and his sharp long nose gave his face a stern frigid expression such as is common with people in the habit of continually thinking of serious things in solitude. Like <mention>Father Christopher</mention> he was wearing a wide-brimmed top-hat, not like a gentleman's, but made of brown felt, and in shape more like a cone with the top cut off than a real top-hat. Probably from a habit acquired in cold winters, when he must more than once have been nearly frozen as he trudged beside the waggons, he kept slapping his thighs and stamping with his feet as he walked. Noticing that <mention>Yegorushka</mention> was awake, <mention connection="s11102,s11104" id="s11145" speaker="Panteley">he</mention> looked at him and said, shrugging his shoulders as though from the cold:

<quote connection="s11145" id="s11102" mention="named552" oid="213" speaker="Panteley">"Ah, you are awake, <mention connection="s11103" id="s11158" speaker="Yegorushka">youngster</mention>! So you are the son of <mention>Ivan Ivanitch</mention>?"</quote>

<quote connection="s11158" id="s11103" mention="named552" oid="214" speaker="Yegorushka">"No; his nephew. . . ."</quote>

<quote connection="s11145" id="s11104" mention="organism430" oid="215" speaker="Panteley">"Nephew of <mention>Ivan Ivanitch</mention>? Here I have taken off my boots and am hopping along barefoot. My feet are bad; they are swollen, and it's easier without my boots . . . easier, youngster . . . without boots, I mean. . . . So you are his nephew? He is a good man; no harm in him. . . . God give him health. . . . No harm in him . . . I mean <mention>Ivan Ivanitch</mention>. . . . He has gone to the Molokans'. . . . O Lord, have mercy upon us!"</quote>

The old man talked, too, as though it were very cold, pausing and not opening his mouth properly; and he mispronounced the labial consonants, stuttering over them as though his lips were frozen. As he talked to <mention>Yegorushka</mention> he did not once smile, and he seemed stern.

Two waggons ahead of them there walked a man wearing a long reddish-brown coat, a cap and high boots with sagging bootlegs and carrying a whip in his hand. This was not <mention>an old man</mention>, only about forty. When he looked round Yegorushka saw a long red face with a scanty goat-beard and a spongy looking swelling under his right eye. Apart from this very ugly swelling, there was another peculiar thing about him which caught the eye at once: in his left hand he carried a whip, while he waved the right as though he were conducting an unseen choir; from time to time he put the whip under his arm, and then he conducted with both hands and hummed something to himself.

The next driver was a long rectilinear figure with extremely sloping shoulders and a back as flat as a board. He held himself as stiffly erect as though he were marching or had swallowed a yard measure. His hands did not swing as he walked, but hung down as if they were straight sticks, and he strode along in a wooden way, after the manner of toy soldiers, almost without bending his knees, and trying to take as long steps as possible. While the old man or the owner of the spongy swelling were taking two steps he succeeded in taking only one, and so it seemed as though he were walking more slowly than any of them, and would drop behind. His face was tied up in a rag, and on his head something stuck up that looked like a monk's peaked cap; he was dressed in a short Little Russian coat, with full dark blue trousers and bark shoes.

<mention>Yegorushka</mention> did not even distinguish those that were farther on. He lay on his stomach, picked a little hole in the bale, and, having nothing better to do, began twisting the wool into a thread. The old man trudging along below him turned out not to be so stern as one might have supposed from his face. Having begun a conversation, he did not let it drop.

Panteley went on muttering, and apparently did not trouble whether <mention>Yegorushka</mention> heard him or not. He talked listlessly, mumbling to himself, without raising or dropping his voice, but succeeded in telling him a great deal in a short time. All he said was made up of fragments that had very little connection with one another, and quite uninteresting for <mention>Yegorushka</mention>. Possibly he talked only in order to reckon over his thoughts aloud after the night spent in silence, in order to see if they were all there. After talking of repentance, <mention connection="s11111" id="s11147" speaker="Panteley">he</mention> spoke about a certain Maxim Nikolaitch from Slavyanoserbsk.

<quote connection="s11147" id="s11111" oid="222" speaker="Panteley">"Yes, he took his little lad; . . . he took him, that's true . . ."</quote>

One of the waggoners walking in front darted from his place, ran to one side and began lashing on the ground with his whip. He was a stalwart, broad-shouldered man of thirty, with curly flaxen hair and a look of great health and vigour. Judging from the movements of his shoulders and the whip, and the eagerness expressed in his attitude, he was beating something alive. Another waggoner, a short stubby little man with a bushy black beard, wearing a waistcoat and a shirt outside his trousers, ran up to him. <mention connection="s11112" id="s11155" speaker="Kiruha">The latter</mention> broke into a deep guffaw of laughter and coughing and said: <quote connection="s11155" id="s11112" oid="223" speaker="Kiruha">"I say, lads, <mention>Dymov</mention> has killed a snake!"</quote>

There are people whose intelligence can be gauged at once by their voice and laughter. The man with the black beard belonged to that class of fortunate individuals; impenetrable stupidity could be felt in his voice and laugh. The flaxen-headed Dymov had finished, and lifting from the ground with his whip something like a cord, flung it with a laugh into the cart.

<quote connection="s11156" id="s11113" oid="224" speaker="Vassya">"That's not a viper; it's a grass snake!"</quote> shouted <mention connection="s11113" id="s11156" speaker="Vassya">someone</mention>.

The man with the wooden gait and the bandage round his face strode up quickly to the dead snake, glanced at it and flung up his stick-like arms.

<quote connection="s11151" id="s11114" mention="organism481" oid="225" speaker="Vassya">"You jail-bird!"</quote> <mention connection="s11114,s11115" id="s11151" speaker="Vassya">he</mention> cried in a hollow wailing voice. <quote connection="s11151" id="s11115" mention="organism481" oid="226" speaker="Vassya">"What have you killed a grass snake for?

Dymov and <mention>the man</mention> with the black beard were probably ashamed, for they laughed loudly, and not answering, slouched lazily back to their waggons. When the hindmost waggon was level with the spot where the dead snake lay, <mention connection="s11118" id="s11149" speaker="Vassya">the man</mention> with his face tied up standing over it turned to <mention>Panteley</mention> and asked in a tearful voice:

<quote connection="s11149" id="s11118" mention="organism489" oid="229" speaker="Vassya">"Grandfather, what did he want to kill the grass snake for?"</quote>

His eyes, as <mention>Yegorushka</mention> saw now, were small and dingy looking; his face was grey, sickly and looked somehow dingy too while his chin was red and seemed very much swollen.

<quote connection="s11150" id="s11119" mention="organism489" oid="230" speaker="Vassya">"Grandfather, what did he kill it for?"</quote> <mention connection="s11119" id="s11150" speaker="Vassya">he</mention> repeated, striding along beside <mention>Panteley</mention>.

The waggoner in the reddish-brown coat and the spongy swelling on his face, who was conducting an unseen choir, stopped. Hearing his name, and waiting till <mention>Panteley</mention> and <mention>Vassya</mention> came up to him, he walked beside them.

<quote connection="s11152" id="s11124" mention="organism496" oid="233" speaker="Emelyan">"What are you talking about?"</quote> <mention connection="s11124" id="s11152" speaker="Emelyan">he</mention> asked in a husky muffled voice.

Emelyan, in his reddish-brown coat, walked between <mention>Panteley</mention> and <mention>Vassya</mention> and waved his arms, as though they were going to sing. After waving them a little while <mention connection="s11129" id="s11154" speaker="Emelyan">he</mention> dropped them, and croaked out hopelessly:

<quote connection="s11154" id="s11129" mention="named627" oid="238" speaker="Emelyan">"I have no voice. It's a real misfortune. All last night and this morning I have been haunted by the trio <quote connection="" id="s11130" oid="" speaker="none">'Lord, have Mercy'</quote> that we sang at the wedding at Marionovsky's. It's in my head and in my throat. It seems as though I could sing it, but I can't; I have no voice."</quote>

<mention connection="s11131,s11133" id="s11153" speaker="Emelyan">He</mention> paused for a minute, thinking, then went on:

<quote connection="s11153" id="s11131" mention="named627" oid="239" speaker="Emelyan">"For fifteen years I was in the choir. In all the Lugansky works there was, maybe, no one with <mention>a voice</mention> like mine. But, confound it, I bathed two years ago in the Donets, and I can't get a single note true ever since. I took cold in my throat. And without <mention>a voice</mention> I am like a workman without hands."</quote>

<quote connection="s9388" id="s11132" mention="named641" oid="240" speaker="Panteley">"That's true,"</quote> <mention connection="s11132" entity="entity364" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s9388" mentiontype="name" oid="named641" speaker="Panteley">Panteley</mention> agreed.

<quote connection="s11153" id="s11133" mention="named627" oid="241" speaker="Emelyan">"I think of myself as a ruined man and nothing more."</quote>

At that moment <mention connection="s11134,s11135" entity="entity429" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s9391" mentiontype="name" oid="named644" speaker="Vassya">Vassya</mention> chanced to catch sight of <mention>Yegorushka</mention>. His eyes grew moist and smaller than ever.

<quote connection="s9391" id="s11134" mention="named644" oid="242" speaker="Vassya">"There's a little gentleman driving with us,"</quote> and he covered his nose with his sleeve as though he were bashful. <quote connection="s9391" id="s11135" mention="named644" oid="243" speaker="Vassya">"What a grand driver! Stay with us and you shall drive the waggons and sell wool."</quote>

The incongruity of one person being at once a little gentleman and a waggon driver seemed to strike him as very queer and funny, for he burst into a loud guffaw, and went on enlarging upon the idea. <mention>Emelyan</mention> glanced upwards at <mention>Yegorushka</mention>, too, but coldly and cursorily. He was absorbed in his own thoughts, and had it not been for <mention>Vassya</mention>, would not have noticed Yegorushka's presence. Before five minutes had passed he was waving his arms again, then describing to his companions the beauties of the wedding anthem, <quote connection="" id="s11136" oid="244" speaker="none">"Lord, have Mercy,"</quote> which he had remembered in the night. He put the whip under his arm and waved both hands.

A mile from the village the waggons stopped by a well with a crane. Letting his pail down into the well, black-bearded Kiruha lay on his stomach on the framework and thrust his shaggy head, his shoulders, and part of his chest into the black hole, so that <mention>Yegorushka</mention> could see nothing but his short legs, which scarcely touched the ground. Seeing the reflection of his head far down at the bottom of the well, he was delighted and went off into his deep bass stupid laugh, and the echo from the well answered him. When he got up his neck and face were as red as beetroot. The first to run up and drink was <mention>Dymov</mention>. He drank laughing, often turning from the pail to tell <mention>Kiruha</mention> something funny, then he turned round, and uttered aloud, to be heard all over the steppe, five very bad words. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> did not understand the meaning of such words, but he knew very well they were bad words. He knew the repulsion his friends and relations silently felt for such words. He himself, without knowing why, shared that feeling and was accustomed to think that only drunk and disorderly people enjoy the privilege of uttering such words aloud. He remembered the murder of the grass snake, listened to Dymov's laughter, and felt something like hatred for <mention>the man</mention>. And as ill-luck would have it, <mention>Dymov</mention> at that moment caught sight of <mention>Yegorushka</mention>, who had climbed down from the waggon and gone up to the well. <mention connection="s11137" id="s11148" speaker="Dymov">He</mention> laughed aloud and shouted:

<quote connection="s11148" id="s11137" mention="named652" oid="245" speaker="Dymov">"I say, lads, the old man has been brought to bed of a boy in the night!"</quote>

Kiruha laughed his bass laugh till he coughed. Someone else laughed too, while <mention>Yegorushka</mention> crimsoned and made up his mind finally that <mention>Dymov</mention> was a very wicked man.

With his curly flaxen head, with his shirt opened on his chest and no hat on, <mention>Dymov</mention> looked handsome and exceptionally strong; in every movement he made one could see the reckless dare-devil and athlete, knowing his value. He shrugged his shoulders, put his arms akimbo, talked and laughed louder than any of the rest, and looked as though he were going to lift up something very heavy with one hand and astonish the whole world by doing so. His mischievous mocking eyes glided over the road, the waggons, and the sky without resting on anything, and seemed looking for <mention>someone</mention> to kill, just as a pastime, and something to laugh at. Evidently he was afraid of no one, would stick at nothing, and most likely was not in the least interested in Yegorushka's opinion of him. . . . <mention>Yegorushka</mention> meanwhile hated his flaxen head, his clear face, and his strength with his whole heart, listened with fear and loathing to his laughter, and kept thinking what word of abuse he could pay him out with.

<mention>Panteley</mention>, too, went up to the pail. He took out of his pocket a little green glass of an ikon lamp, wiped it with a rag, filled it from the pail and drank from it, then filled it again, wrapped the little glass in the rag, and then put it back into his pocket.

<quote connection="s9431" id="s11138" mention="named667" oid="246" speaker="Yegorushka">"Grandfather, why do you drink out of a lamp?"</quote> <mention connection="s11138" entity="entity11" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s9431" mentiontype="name" oid="named667" speaker="Yegorushka">Yegorushka</mention> asked him, surprised.

<quote connection="s9433" id="s11139" mention="organism519" oid="247" speaker="Panteley">"One man drinks out of a pail and another out of a lamp,"</quote> <mention class="old man" connection="s11139,s11140" entity="organism519" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s9433" mentiontype="nominal" modifier="" oid="organism519" speaker="Panteley">the old man</mention> answered evasively. <quote connection="s9433" id="s11140" mention="organism519" oid="248" speaker="Panteley">"Every man to his own taste. . . .

<quote connection="s9435" id="s11141" mention="named668" oid="249" speaker="Vassya">"You darling, you beauty!"</quote> <mention connection="s11141,s11142,s11144" entity="entity429" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s9435" mentiontype="name" oid="named668" speaker="Vassya">Vassya</mention> said suddenly, in a caressing, plaintive voice. <quote connection="s9435" id="s11142" mention="named668" oid="250" speaker="Vassya">"You darling!"</quote>

His eyes were fixed on the distance; they were moist and smiling, and his face wore the same expression as when he had looked at <mention>Yegorushka</mention>.

<quote connection="s9438" id="s11143" mention="named670" oid="251" speaker="Kiruha">"Who is it you are talking to?"</quote> asked <mention connection="s11143" entity="entity381" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s9438" mentiontype="name" oid="named670" speaker="Kiruha">Kiruha</mention>.

<quote connection="s9435" id="s11144" mention="named668" oid="252" speaker="Vassya">"A darling fox, . . . lying on her back, playing like a dog."</quote>

Everyone began staring into the distance, looking for the fox, but no one could see it, only Vassya with his grey muddy-looking eyes, and he was enchanted by it. His sight was extraordinarily keen, as <mention>Yegorushka</mention> learnt afterwards. He was so long-sighted that the brown steppe was for him always full of life and interest. He had only to look into the distance to see a fox, a hare, a bustard, or some other animal keeping at a distance from men. There was nothing strange in seeing a hare running away or a flying bustard-- everyone crossing the steppes could see them; but it was not vouchsafed to everyone to see wild animals in their own haunts when they were not running nor hiding, nor looking about them in alarm. Yet <mention>Vassya</mention> saw foxes playing, hares washing themselves with their paws, bustards preening their wings and hammering out their hollow nests. Thanks to this keenness of sight, <mention>Vassya</mention> had, besides the world seen by everyone, another world of his own, accessible to no one else, and probably a very beautiful one, for when he saw something and was in raptures over it it was impossible not to envy him.

When the waggons set off again, the church bells were ringing for service.</chapter><chapter>V

The train of waggons drew up on the bank of a river on one side of a village. The sun was blazing, as it had been the day before; the air was stagnant and depressing. There were a few willows on the bank, but the shade from them did not fall on the earth, but on the water, where it was wasted; even in the shade under the waggon it was stifling and wearisome. The water, blue from the reflection of the sky in it, was alluring.

<mention>Styopka</mention>, a waggoner whom <mention>Yegorushka</mention> noticed now for the first time, a Little Russian lad of eighteen, in a long shirt without a belt, and full trousers that flapped like flags as he walked, undressed quickly, ran along the steep bank and plunged into the water. He dived three times, then swam on his back and shut his eyes in his delight. His face was smiling and wrinkled up as though he were being tickled, hurt and amused.

On a hot day when there is nowhere to escape from the sultry, stifling heat, the splash of water and the loud breathing of a man bathing sounds like good music to the ear. <mention>Dymov</mention> and <mention>Kiruha</mention>, looking at <mention>Styopka</mention>, undressed quickly and one after the other, laughing loudly in eager anticipation of their enjoyment, dropped into the water, and the quiet, modest little river resounded with snorting and splashing and shouting. <mention>Kiruha</mention> coughed, laughed and shouted as though they were trying to drown him, while <mention>Dymov</mention> chased him and tried to catch him by the leg.

<quote connection="s14110" id="s14046" mention="named685" oid="253" speaker="Dymov">"Ha-ha-ha!"</quote> <mention connection="s14046,s14047" id="s14110" speaker="Dymov">he</mention> shouted. <quote connection="s14110" id="s14047" mention="named685" oid="254" speaker="Dymov">"Catch him! Hold him!"</quote>

Kiruha laughed and enjoyed himself, but his expression was the same as it had been on dry land, stupid, with a look of astonishment on it as though <mention>someone</mention> had, unnoticed, stolen up behind him and hit him on the head with the butt-end of an axe. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> undressed, too, but did not let himself down by the bank, but took a run and a flying leap from the height of about ten feet. Describing an arc in the air, he fell into the water, sank deep, but did not reach the bottom; some force, cold and pleasant to the touch, seemed to hold him up and bring him back to the surface. He popped out and, snorting and blowing bubbles, opened his eyes; but the sun was reflected in the water quite close to his face. At first blinding spots of light, then rainbow colours and dark patches, flitted before his eyes. He made haste to dive again, opened his eyes in the water and saw something cloudy-green like a sky on a moonlight night. Again the same force would not let him touch the bottom and stay in the coolness, but lifted him to the surface. He popped out and heaved a sigh so deep that he had a feeling of space and freshness, not only in his chest, but in his stomach. Then, to get from the water everything he possibly could get, he allowed himself every luxury; he lay on his back and basked, splashed, frolicked, swam on his face, on his side, on his back and standing up-- just as he pleased till he was exhausted. The other bank was thickly overgrown with reeds; it was golden in the sun, and the flowers of the reeds hung drooping to the water in lovely tassels. In one place the reeds were shaking and nodding, with their flowers rustling-- <mention>Styopka</mention> and <mention>Kiruha</mention> were hunting crayfish.

<quote connection="s12393" id="s14048" mention="named690" oid="255" speaker="Kiruha">"A crayfish, look, lads! A crayfish!"</quote> <mention connection="s14048" entity="entity381" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s12393" mentiontype="name" oid="named690" speaker="Kiruha">Kiruha</mention> cried triumphantly and actually showed a crayfish.

Yegorushka swam up to the reeds, dived, and began fumbling among their roots. Burrowing in the slimy, liquid mud, he felt something sharp and unpleasant-- perhaps it really was a crayfish. But at that minute <mention>someone</mention> seized him by the leg and pulled him to the surface. Spluttering and coughing, <mention>Yegorushka</mention> opened his eyes and saw before him the wet grinning face of the dare-devil Dymov. The impudent fellow was breathing hard, and from a look in his eyes he seemed inclined for further mischief. He held <mention>Yegorushka</mention> tight by the leg, and was lifting his hand to take hold of his neck. But <mention connection="s14049" entity="entity11" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s12401" mentiontype="name" oid="named694" speaker="Yegorushka">Yegorushka</mention> tore himself away with repulsion and terror, as though disgusted at being touched and afraid that the bully would drown him, and said:

<quote connection="s12401" id="s14049" mention="named694" oid="256" speaker="Yegorushka">"Fool! I'll punch you in the face."</quote>

Feeling that this was not sufficient to express his hatred, <mention connection="s14050" id="s14109" speaker="Yegorushka">he</mention> thought a minute and added:

<quote connection="s12404" id="s14056" mention="named699" oid="263" speaker="Dymov">"That's true."</quote>

Styopka clambered out of the water, dressed quickly, and without a cap on he ran, his full trousers flapping, to the village. The water lost all its charm for <mention>Yegorushka</mention> after his encounter with <mention>Dymov</mention>. He got out and began dressing. <mention>Panteley</mention> and <mention>Vassya</mention> were sitting on the steep bank, with their legs hanging down, looking at the bathers. <mention>Emelyan</mention> was standing naked, up to his knees in the water, holding on to the grass with one hand to prevent himself from falling while the other stroked his body. With his bony shoulder-blades, with the swelling under his eye, bending down and evidently afraid of the water, he made a ludicrous figure. His face was grave and severe. He looked angrily at the water, as though he were just going to upbraid it for having given him cold in the Donets and robbed him of his voice.

Styopka soon came back with the net. <mention>Dymov</mention> and <mention>Kiruha</mention> were already turning blue and getting hoarse by being so long in the water, but they set about fishing eagerly. First they went to a deep place beside the reeds; there <mention>Dymov</mention> was up to his neck, while the water went over squat Kiruha's head. The latter spluttered and blew bubbles, while <mention>Dymov</mention> stumbling on the prickly roots, fell over and got caught in the net; both flopped about in the water, and made a noise, and nothing but mischief came of their fishing.

<quote connection="s12436" id="s14061" mention="named720" oid="268" speaker="Kiruha">"It's deep,"</quote> croaked <mention connection="s14061,s14062" entity="entity381" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s12436" mentiontype="name" oid="named720" speaker="Kiruha">Kiruha</mention>. <quote connection="s12436" id="s14062" mention="named720" oid="269" speaker="Kiruha">"You won't catch anything."</quote>

Go more to the left! It's shallower there!"</quote>

Once a big fish gleamed above the net; they all drew a breath, and <mention>Dymov</mention> struck the place where it had vanished with his fist, and his face expressed vexation.

<quote connection="s12442" id="s14067" mention="named724" oid="274" speaker="Panteley">"Ugh!"</quote> cried <mention connection="s14067,s14068" entity="entity364" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s12442" mentiontype="name" oid="named724" speaker="Panteley">Panteley</mention>, and he stamped his foot. <quote connection="s12442" id="s14068" mention="named724" oid="275" speaker="Panteley">"You've let the perch slip! It's gone!"</quote>

Moving more to the left, <mention>Dymov</mention> and <mention>Kiruha</mention> picked out a shallower place, and then fishing began in earnest. They had wandered off some hundred paces from the waggons; they could be seen silently trying to go as deep as they could and as near the reeds, moving their legs a little at a time, drawing out the nets, beating the water with their fists to drive them towards the nets. From the reeds they got to the further bank; they drew the net out, then, with a disappointed air, lifting their knees high as they walked, went back into the reeds. They were talking about something, but what it was no one could hear. The sun was scorching their backs, the flies were stinging them, and their bodies had turned from purple to crimson. <mention>Styopka</mention> was walking after them with a pail in his hands; he had tucked his shirt right up under his armpits, and was holding it up by the hem with his teeth. After every successful catch <mention connection="s14069" id="s14111" speaker="Styopka">he</mention> lifted up some fish, and letting it shine in the sun, shouted:

<quote connection="s14111" id="s14069" mention="named725" oid="276" speaker="Styopka">"Look at this perch! We've five like that!"</quote>

Every time <mention>Dymov</mention>, <mention>Kiruha</mention> and <mention>Styopka</mention> pulled out the net they could be seen fumbling about in the mud in it, putting some things into the pail and throwing other things away; sometimes they passed something that was in the net from hand to hand, examined it inquisitively, then threw that, too, away.

<quote connection="s14112" id="s14070" oid="277" speaker="Dymov_and_Kiruha_and_Styopka">"What is it?"</quote> <mention connection="s14070" id="s14112" speaker="Dymov_and_Kiruha_and_Styopka">they</mention> shouted to them from the bank.

<mention>Styopka</mention> made some answer, but it was hard to make out his words. Then he climbed out of the water and, holding the pail in both hands, forgetting to let his shirt drop, ran to the waggons.

<quote connection="s14113" id="s14114" speaker="Styopka">"It's full!"</quote> <mention connection="s14114,s14115" id="s14113" speaker="Styopka">he</mention> shouted, breathing hard. <quote connection="s14113" id="s14115" speaker="Styopka">"Give us another!"</quote>

Yegorushka looked into the pail: it was full. A young pike poked its ugly nose out of the water, and there were swarms of crayfish and little fish round about it. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> put his hand down to the bottom and stirred up the water; the pike vanished under the crayfish and a perch and a tench swam to the surface instead of it. <mention>Vassya</mention>, too, looked into the pail. His eyes grew moist and his face looked as caressing as before when he saw the fox. He took something out of the pail, put it to his mouth and began chewing it.

<quote connection="s12461" id="s14073" mention="named736" oid="280" speaker="Styopka">"Mates,"</quote> said <mention connection="s14073,s14074" entity="entity473" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s12461" mentiontype="name" oid="named736" speaker="Styopka">Styopka</mention> in amazement, <quote connection="s12461" id="s14074" mention="named736" oid="281" speaker="Styopka">"<mention>Vassya</mention> is eating a live gudgeon! Phoo!"</quote>

<quote connection="s12465" id="s14075" mention="named738" oid="282" speaker="Vassya">"It's not a gudgeon, but a minnow,"</quote> <mention connection="s14075" entity="entity429" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s12465" mentiontype="name" oid="named738" speaker="Vassya">Vassya</mention> answered calmly, still munching.

He took a fish's tail out of his mouth, looked at it caressingly, and put it back again. While he was chewing and crunching with his teeth it seemed to <mention>Yegorushka</mention> that he saw before him something not human. Vassya's swollen chin, his lustreless eyes, his extraordinary sharp sight, the fish's tail in his mouth, and the caressing friendliness with which he crunched the gudgeon made him like an animal.

<mention>Yegorushka</mention> felt dreary beside him. And the fishing was over, too. He walked about beside the waggons, thought a little, and, feeling bored, strolled off to the village.

Not long afterwards he was standing in the church, and with his forehead leaning on somebody's back, listened to the singing of the choir. The service was drawing to a close. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> did not understand church singing and did not care for it. He listened a little, yawned, and began looking at the backs and heads before him. In one head, red and wet from his recent bathe, he recognized <mention>Emelyan</mention>. The back of his head had been cropped in a straight line higher than is usual; the hair in front had been cut unbecomingly high, and Emelyan's ears stood out like two dock leaves, and seemed to feel themselves out of place. Looking at the back of his head and his ears, <mention>Yegorushka</mention>, for some reason, thought that <mention>Emelyan</mention> was probably very unhappy. He remembered the way he conducted with his hands, his husky voice, his timid air when he was bathing, and felt intense pity for him. He longed to say something friendly to him.

<quote connection="s14116" id="s14076" mention="named743" oid="283" speaker="Yegorushka">"I am here, too,"</quote> <mention connection="s14076" id="s14116" speaker="Yegorushka">he</mention> said, putting out his hand.

People who sing tenor or bass in the choir, especially those who have at any time in their lives conducted, are accustomed to look with a stern and unfriendly air at boys. They do not give up this habit, even when they leave off being in a choir. Turning to <mention>Yegorushka</mention>, <mention connection="s14077" entity="entity432" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s12482" mentiontype="name" oid="named749" speaker="Emelyan">Emelyan</mention> looked at him from under his brows and said:

<quote connection="s12482" id="s14077" mention="named749" oid="284" speaker="Emelyan">"Don't play in church!"</quote>

Then <mention>Yegorushka</mention> moved forwards nearer to the ikon-stand. Here he saw interesting people. On the right side, in front of everyone, a lady and a gentleman were standing on a carpet. There were chairs behind them. The gentleman was wearing newly ironed shantung trousers; he stood as motionless as a soldier saluting, and held high his bluish shaven chin. There was a very great air of dignity in his stand-up collar, in his blue chin, in his small bald patch and his cane. His neck was so strained from excess of dignity, and his chin was drawn up so tensely, that it looked as though his head were ready to fly off and soar upwards any minute. <mention class="lady" connection="s14078" entity="organism573" entitytype="PERSON" gender="female" id="s12489" mentiontype="nominal" modifier="" oid="organism573" speaker="the_lady">The lady</mention>, who was stout and elderly and wore a white silk shawl, held her head on one side and looked as though she had done <mention>someone</mention> a favour, and wanted to say: <quote connection="s12489" id="s14078" mention="organism573" oid="285" speaker="the_lady">"Oh, don't trouble yourself to thank me; I don't like it . . . ."</quote> A thick wall of Little Russian heads stood all round the carpet.

<mention>Yegorushka</mention> went up to the ikon-stand and began kissing the local ikons. Before each image he slowly bowed down to the ground, without getting up, looked round at the congregation, then got up and kissed the ikon. The contact of his forehead with the cold floor afforded him great satisfaction. When <mention>the beadle</mention> came from the altar with a pair of long snuffers to put out the candles, <mention>Yegorushka</mention> jumped up quickly from the floor and ran up to him.

<quote connection="s14117" id="s14079" mention="named754" oid="286" speaker="Yegorushka">"Have they given out the holy bread?"</quote> <mention connection="s14079" id="s14117" speaker="Yegorushka">he</mention> asked.

The service was over; <mention>Yegorushka</mention> walked out of the church in a leisurely way, and began strolling about the market-place. He had seen a good many villages, market-places, and peasants in his time, and everything that met his eyes was entirely without interest for him. At a loss for something to do, he went into a shop over the door of which hung a wide strip of red cotton. The shop consisted of two roomy, badly lighted parts; in one half they sold drapery and groceries, in the other there were tubs of tar, and there were horse-collars hanging from the ceiling; from both came the savoury smell of leather and tar. The floor of the shop had been watered; <mention>the man</mention> who watered it must have been a very whimsical and original person, for it was sprinkled in patterns and mysterious symbols. <mention class="shopkeeper" connection="s14082" entity="organism580" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s12501" mentiontype="nominal" modifier="" oid="organism580" speaker="the_shopkeeper">The shopkeeper</mention>, an overfed-looking man with a broad face and round beard, apparently a Great Russian, was standing, leaning his person over the counter. He was nibbling a piece of sugar as he drank his tea, and heaved a deep sigh at every sip. His face expressed complete indifference, but each sigh seemed to be saying:

<quote connection="s12501" id="s14082" mention="organism580" oid="289" speaker="the_shopkeeper">"Just wait a minute; I will give it you."</quote>

<quote connection="s12508" id="s14083" mention="named758" oid="290" speaker="Yegorushka">"Give me a farthing's worth of sunflower seeds,"</quote> <mention connection="s14083" entity="entity11" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s12508" mentiontype="name" oid="named758" speaker="Yegorushka">Yegorushka</mention> said, addressing him.

<quote connection="s14118" id="s14084" mention="named760" oid="291" speaker="Yegorushka">"How much are these cakes?"</quote>

<quote connection="s12509" id="s14085" mention="organism585" oid="292" speaker="the_shopkeeper">"Two for a farthing."</quote>

The shopman took the cake in his hands, looked at it from all sides, and raised one eyebrow.

<quote connection="s14120" id="s14119" speaker="the_shopkeeper">"Like that?"</quote> <mention connection="s14119" id="s14120" speaker="the_shopkeeper">he</mention> asked.

Then <mention connection="s14122" id="s14121" speaker="the_shopkeeper">he</mention> raised the other eyebrow, thought a minute, and answered:

<quote connection="s14121" id="s14122" speaker="the_shopkeeper">"Two for three farthings. . . ."</quote>

A silence followed.

He looked over Yegorushka's head towards the door, paused a minute and asked:

The shopkeeper poured him out a glass and gave him with it a bit of sugar that looked as though it had been nibbled. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> sat down on the folding chair and began drinking it. He wanted to ask the price of a pound of sugar almonds, and had just broached the subject when a customer walked in, and <mention>the shopkeeper</mention>, leaving his glass of tea, attended to his business. He led <mention>the customer</mention> into the other half, where there was a smell of tar, and was there a long time discussing something with him. The customer, a man apparently very obstinate and pig-headed, was continually shaking his head to signify his disapproval, and retreating towards the door. The shopkeeper tried to persuade him of something and began pouring some oats into a big sack for him.

<quote connection="s12533" id="s14094" mention="organism601" oid="301" speaker="the_customer">"Do you call those oats?"</quote> <mention class="customer" connection="s14094,s14095" entity="organism601" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s12533" mentiontype="nominal" modifier="" oid="organism601" speaker="the_customer">the customer</mention> said gloomily. <quote connection="s12533" id="s14095" mention="organism601" oid="302" speaker="the_customer">"Those are not oats, but chaff. It's a mockery to give that to the hens; enough to make the hens laugh. . . . No, I will go to Bondarenko."</quote>

When <mention>Yegorushka</mention> went back to the river a small camp fire was smoking on the bank. The waggoners were cooking their dinner. <mention>Styopka</mention> was standing in the smoke, stirring the cauldron with a big notched spoon. A little on one side Kiruha and <mention>Vassya</mention>, with eyes reddened from the smoke, were sitting cleaning the fish. Before them lay the net covered with slime and water weeds, and on it lay gleaming fish and crawling crayfish.

<mention connection="s14096" id="s14125" speaker="Emelyan">Emelyan</mention>, who had not long been back from the church, was sitting beside <mention>Panteley</mention>, waving his arm and humming just audibly in a husky voice: <quote connection="s14125" id="s14096" mention="named773" oid="303" speaker="Emelyan">"To Thee we sing. . . ."</quote> Dymov was moving about by the horses.

When they had finished cleaning them, <mention>Kiruha</mention> and <mention>Vassya</mention> put the fish and the living crayfish together in the pail, rinsed them, and from the pail poured them all into the boiling water.

<quote connection="s12553" id="s14097" mention="named778" oid="304" speaker="Styopka">"Shall I put in some fat?"</quote> asked <mention connection="s14097" entity="entity473" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s12553" mentiontype="name" oid="named778" speaker="Styopka">Styopka</mention>, skimming off the froth.

<quote connection="s12555" id="s14098" mention="named780" oid="305" speaker="Kiruha">"No need.

Before taking the cauldron off the fire Styopka scattered into the water three big handfuls of millet and a spoonful of salt; finally he tried it, smacked his lips, licked the spoon, and gave a self-satisfied grunt, which meant that the grain was done.

All except <mention>Panteley</mention> sat down near the cauldron and set to work with their spoons.

<quote connection="s12560" id="s14099" mention="named783" oid="306" speaker="Panteley">"You there! Give the little lad a spoon!"</quote> <mention connection="s14099,s14100,s14102" entity="entity364" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s12560" mentiontype="name" oid="named783" speaker="Panteley">Panteley</mention> observed sternly. <quote connection="s12560" id="s14100" mention="named783" oid="307" speaker="Panteley">"I dare say he is hungry too!"</quote>

<quote connection="s12560" id="s14102" mention="named783" oid="309" speaker="Panteley">"Peasant fare is welcome, too, when one is hungry."</quote>

They gave <mention>Yegorushka</mention> a spoon. He began eating, not sitting, but standing close to the cauldron and looking down into it as in a hole. The grain smelt of fish and fish-scales were mixed up with the millet. The crayfish could not be hooked out with a spoon, and the men simply picked them out of the cauldron with their hands; <mention>Vassya</mention> did so particularly freely, and wetted his sleeves as well as his hands in the mess. But yet the stew seemed to <mention>Yegorushka</mention> very nice, and reminded him of the crayfish soup which his mother used to make at home on fast-days. <mention>Panteley</mention> was sitting apart munching bread.

<quote connection="s12573" id="s14103" mention="named791" oid="310" speaker="Emelyan">"Grandfather, why aren't you eating?"</quote> <mention connection="s14103" entity="entity432" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s12573" mentiontype="name" oid="named791" speaker="Emelyan">Emelyan</mention> asked him.

While they were eating they all talked. From this conversation <mention>Yegorushka</mention> gathered that all his new acquaintances, in spite of the differences of their ages and their characters, had one point in common which made them all alike: they were all people with a splendid past and a very poor present. Of their past they all-- every one of them-- spoke with enthusiasm; their attitude to the present was almost one of contempt. The Russian loves recalling life, but he does not love living. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> did not yet know that, and before the stew had been all eaten he firmly believed that the men sitting round the cauldron were the injured victims of fate. <mention>Panteley</mention> told them that in the past, before there were railways, he used to go with trains of waggons to Moscow and to Nizhni, and used to earn so much that he did not know what to do with his money; and what merchants there used to be in those days! what fish! how cheap everything was! Now the roads were shorter, the merchants were stingier, <mention>the peasants</mention> were poorer, the bread was dearer, everything had shrunk and was on a smaller scale. <mention>Emelyan</mention> told them that in old days he had been in the choir in the Lugansky works, and that he had a remarkable voice and read music splendidly, while now he had become a peasant and lived on the charity of his brother, who sent him out with his horses and took half his earnings. <mention>Vassya</mention> had once worked in a match factory; <mention>Kiruha</mention> had been a coachman in a good family, and had been reckoned the smartest driver of a three-in-hand in the whole district. <mention>Dymov</mention>, the son of a well-to-do peasant, lived at ease, enjoyed himself and had known no trouble till he was twenty, when his stern harsh father, anxious to train him to work, and afraid he would be spoiled at home, had sent him to a carrier's to work as a hired labourer. <mention>Styopka</mention> was the only one who said nothing, but from his beardless face it was evident that his life had been a much better one in the past.

Thinking of his father, <mention>Dymov</mention> frowned and left off eating. Sullenly from under his brows he looked round at his companions and his eye rested upon <mention>Yegorushka</mention>.

<quote connection="s14126" id="s14105" mention="named806" oid="312" speaker="Dymov">"You heathen, take off your cap,"</quote> <mention connection="s14105,s14106" id="s14126" speaker="Dymov">he</mention> said rudely. <quote connection="s14126" id="s14106" mention="named806" oid="313" speaker="Dymov">"You can't eat with your cap on, and you a gentleman too!"</quote>

Yegorushka took off his hat and did not say a word, but the stew lost all savour for him, and he did not hear <mention>Panteley</mention> and <mention>Vassya</mention> intervening on his behalf. A feeling of anger with the insulting fellow was rankling oppressively in his breast, and he made up his mind that he would do him some injury, whatever it cost him.

After dinner everyone sauntered to the waggons and lay down in the shade.

<quote connection="s12618" id="s14107" mention="named810" oid="314" speaker="Yegorushka">"Are we going to start soon, grandfather?"</quote> <mention connection="s14107" entity="entity11" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s12618" mentiontype="name" oid="named810" speaker="Yegorushka">Yegorushka</mention> asked <mention connection="s14108" entity="entity364" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s12619" mentiontype="name" oid="named811" speaker="Panteley">Panteley</mention>.

Soon there was a sound of snoring from under the waggons. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> meant to go back to the village, but on consideration, yawned and lay down by the old man.</chapter><chapter>VI

The waggons remained by the river the whole day, and set off again when the sun was setting.

<mention>Yegorushka</mention> was lying on the bales again; the waggon creaked softly and swayed from side to side. <mention>Panteley</mention> walked below, stamping his feet, slapping himself on his thighs and muttering. The air was full of the churring music of the steppes, as it had been the day before.

<mention>Yegorushka</mention> lay on his back, and, putting his hands under his head, gazed upwards at the sky. He watched the glow of sunset kindle, then fade away; guardian angels covering the horizon with their gold wings disposed themselves to slumber. The day had passed peacefully; the quiet peaceful night had come, and they could stay tranquilly at home in heaven. . . . <mention>Yegorushka</mention> saw the sky by degrees grow dark and the mist fall over the earth-- saw the stars light up, one after the other. . . .

When you gaze a long while fixedly at the deep sky thoughts and feelings for some reason merge in a sense of loneliness. One begins to feel hopelessly solitary, and everything one used to look upon as near and akin becomes infinitely remote and valueless; the stars that have looked down from the sky thousands of years already, the mists and the incomprehensible sky itself, indifferent to the brief life of man, oppress the soul with their silence when one is left face to face with them and tries to grasp their significance. One is reminded of the solitude awaiting each one of us in the grave, and the reality of life seems awful . . . full of despair. . . .

<mention>Yegorushka</mention> thought of his grandmother, who was sleeping now under the cherry-trees in the cemetery. He remembered how she lay in her coffin with pennies on her eyes, how afterwards she was shut in and let down into the grave; he even recalled the hollow sound of the clods of earth on the coffin lid. . . . He pictured his granny in the dark and narrow coffin, helpless and deserted by everyone. His imagination pictured his granny suddenly awakening, not understanding where she was, knocking upon the lid and calling for help, and in the end swooning with horror and dying again. He imagined his mother dead, Father Christopher, Countess Dranitsky, <mention>Solomon</mention>. But however much he tried to imagine himself in the dark tomb, far from home, outcast, helpless and dead, he could not succeed; for himself personally he could not admit the possibility of death, and felt that he would never die. . . .

<mention>Panteley</mention>, for whom death could not be far away, walked below and went on reckoning up his thoughts.

<quote connection="s17144" id="s17070" mention="named825" oid="316" speaker="Panteley">"All right. . . . Nice gentlefolk, . . ."</quote> <mention connection="s14444,s17070" id="s17144" speaker="Panteley">he</mention> muttered. <quote connection="s17144" id="s14444" speaker="Panteley">"Took his little lad to school-- but how he is doing now I haven't heard say --in Slavyanoserbsk.

Next day they found nothing but bones."</quote>

About midnight Yegorushka and the waggoners were again sitting round a small camp fire. While the dry twigs and stems were burning up, <mention>Kiruha</mention> and <mention>Vassya</mention> went off somewhere to get water from a creek; they vanished into the darkness, but could be heard all the time talking and clinking their pails; so the creek was not far away. The light from the fire lay a great flickering patch on the earth; though the moon was bright, yet everything seemed impenetrably black beyond that red patch. The light was in the waggoners' eyes, and they saw only part of the great road; almost unseen in the darkness the waggons with the bales and the horses looked like a mountain of undefined shape. Twenty paces from the camp fire at the edge of the road stood a wooden cross that had fallen aslant. Before the camp fire had been lighted, when he could still see things at a distance, <mention>Yegorushka</mention> had noticed that there was a similar old slanting cross on the other side of the great road.

Coming back with the water, <mention>Kiruha</mention> and <mention>Vassya</mention> filled the cauldron and fixed it over the fire. <mention>Styopka</mention>, with the notched spoon in his hand, took his place in the smoke by the cauldron, gazing dreamily into the water for the scum to rise. <mention>Panteley</mention> and <mention>Emelyan</mention> were sitting side by side in silence, brooding over something. <mention>Dymov</mention> was lying on his stomach, with his head propped on his fists, looking into the fire. . . . Styopka's shadow was dancing over him, so that his handsome face was at one minute covered with darkness, at the next lighted up. . . . <mention>Kiruha</mention> and <mention>Vassya</mention> were wandering about at a little distance gathering dry grass and bark for the fire. <mention>Yegorushka</mention>, with his hands in his pockets, was standing by <mention>Panteley</mention>, watching how the fire devoured the grass.

All were resting, musing on something, and they glanced cursorily at the cross over which patches of red light were dancing. There is something melancholy, pensive, and extremely poetical about a solitary tomb; one feels its silence, and the silence gives one the sense of the presence of the soul of the unknown man who lies under the cross. Is that soul at peace on the steppe? Does it grieve in the moonlight? Near the tomb the steppe seems melancholy, dreary and mournful; the grass seems more sorrowful, and one fancies the grasshoppers chirrup less freely, and there is no passer-by who would not remember that lonely soul and keep looking back at the tomb, till it was left far behind and hidden in the mists. . . .

<quote connection="s15652" id="s17072" mention="named854" oid="318" speaker="Yegorushka">"Grandfather, what is that cross for?"</quote> asked <mention connection="s17072" entity="entity11" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s15652" mentiontype="name" oid="named854" speaker="Yegorushka">Yegorushka</mention>.

A silence followed. <mention>Kiruha</mention> broke up some dry stalks, crushed them up together and thrust them under the cauldron. The fire flared up brightly; <mention>Styopka</mention> was enveloped in black smoke, and the shadow cast by the cross danced along the road in the dusk beside the waggons.

So we put up there and were all right. My merchant was in a room, while I was with the horses, and everything was as it should be. So, lads, I said my prayers before going to sleep and began walking about the yard. And it was a dark night, I couldn't see anything; it was no good trying.

Kiruha, trying not to make a noise, thrust a handful of twigs into the fire.

Panteley had finished his story, and he looked round at his listeners. They were gazing at him in silence. The water was boiling by now and <mention>Styopka</mention> was skimming off the froth.

<quote connection="s15847" id="s17098" mention="named964" oid="344" speaker="Dymov">"Who was it knocked at the window?"</quote> asked <mention connection="s17098" entity="entity420" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s15847" mentiontype="name" oid="named964" speaker="Dymov">Dymov</mention>.

Panteley told other stories, and in all of them <quote connection="" id="s17100" oid="346" speaker="none">"long knives"</quote> figured and all alike sounded made up. Had he heard these stories from <mention>someone</mention> else, or had he made them up himself in the remote past, and afterwards, as his memory grew weaker, mixed up his experiences with his imaginations and become unable to distinguish one from the other? Anything is possible, but it is strange that on this occasion and for the rest of the journey, whenever he happened to tell a story, he gave unmistakable preference to fiction, and never told of what he really had experienced. At the time <mention>Yegorushka</mention> took it all for the genuine thing, and believed every word; later on it seemed to him strange that a man who in his day had travelled all over Russia and seen and known so much, whose wife and <mention>children</mention> had been burnt to death, so failed to appreciate the wealth of his life that whenever he was sitting by the camp fire he was either silent or talked of what had never been.

Over their porridge they were all silent, thinking of what they had just heard. Life is terrible and marvellous, and so, however terrible a story you tell in Russia, however you embroider it with nests of robbers, long knives and such marvels, it always finds an echo of reality in the soul of the listener, and only a man who has been a good deal affected by education looks askance distrustfully, and even he will be silent. The cross by the roadside, the dark bales of wool, the wide expanse of the plain, and the lot of the men gathered together by the camp fire-- all this was of itself so marvellous and terrible that the fantastic colours of legend and fairy-tale were pale and blended with life.

All the others ate out of the cauldron, but <mention>Panteley</mention> sat apart and ate his porridge out of a wooden bowl. His spoon was not like those the others had, but was made of cypress wood, with a little cross on it. <mention connection="s17101" entity="entity11" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s15861" mentiontype="name" oid="named970" speaker="Yegorushka">Yegorushka</mention>, looking at him, thought of the little ikon glass and asked <mention>Styopka</mention> softly:

<quote connection="s15861" id="s17101" mention="named970" oid="347" speaker="Yegorushka">"Why does Grandfather sit apart?"</quote>

<quote connection="s17191" id="s17102" oid="348" speaker="Styopka_and_Vassya">"He is an Old Believer,"</quote> <mention connection="s17102" id="s17191" speaker="Styopka_and_Vassya">Styopka and Vassya</mention> answered in a whisper. And as they said it they looked as though they were speaking of some secret vice or weakness.

All sat silent, thinking. After the terrible stories there was no inclination to speak of ordinary things. All at once in the midst of the silence <mention>Vassya</mention> drew himself up and, fixing his lustreless eyes on one point, pricked up his ears.

<quote connection="s15868" id="s17103" mention="named977" oid="349" speaker="Dymov">"What is it?"</quote> <mention connection="s17103,s17105" entity="entity420" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s15868" mentiontype="name" oid="named977" speaker="Dymov">Dymov</mention> asked him.

<quote connection="s15869" id="s17104" mention="named978" oid="350" speaker="Vassya">"Someone is coming,"</quote> answered <mention connection="s17104,s17106,s17108" entity="entity429" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s15869" mentiontype="name" oid="named978" speaker="Vassya">Vassya</mention>.

<quote connection="s15868" id="s17105" mention="named977" oid="351" speaker="Dymov">"Where do you see him?"</quote>

<quote connection="s15869" id="s17106" mention="named978" oid="352" speaker="Vassya">"Yo-on-der! There's something white. . ."</quote>

There was nothing to be seen but darkness in the direction in which <mention>Vassya</mention> was looking; everyone listened, but they could hear no sound of steps.

<quote connection="s15871" id="s17107" mention="named980" oid="353" speaker="Dymov">"Is he coming by the highroad?"</quote> asked <mention connection="s17107" entity="entity420" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s15871" mentiontype="name" oid="named980" speaker="Dymov">Dymov</mention>.

<quote connection="s15869" id="s17108" mention="named979" oid="354" speaker="Vassya">"No, over the open country. . . . He is coming this way."</quote>

A minute passed in silence.

<quote connection="s15873" id="s17109" mention="named981" oid="355" speaker="Dymov">"And maybe it's <mention>the merchant</mention> who was buried here walking over the steppe,"</quote> said <mention connection="s17109" entity="entity420" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s15873" mentiontype="name" oid="named981" speaker="Dymov">Dymov</mention>.

All looked askance at the cross, exchanged glances and suddenly broke into a laugh. They felt ashamed of their terror.

<quote connection="s15875" id="s17110" mention="named982" oid="356" speaker="Panteley">"Why should he walk?"</quote> asked <mention connection="s17110,s17111" entity="entity364" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s15875" mentiontype="name" oid="named982" speaker="Panteley">Panteley</mention>. <quote connection="s15875" id="s17111" mention="named982" oid="357" speaker="Panteley">"It's only those walk at night whom the earth will not take to herself. And the merchants were all right. . . . The merchants have received the crown of martyrs."</quote>

But all at once they heard <mention>the sound</mention> of steps; <mention>someone</mention> was coming in haste.

<quote connection="s15879" id="s17112" mention="named983" oid="358" speaker="Vassya">"He's carrying something,"</quote> said <mention connection="s17112" entity="entity429" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s15879" mentiontype="name" oid="named983" speaker="Vassya">Vassya</mention>.

They could hear the grass rustling and the dry twigs crackling under the feet of the approaching wayfarer. But from the glare of the camp fire nothing could be seen. At last the steps sounded close by, and <mention>someone</mention> coughed. The flickering light seemed to part; a veil dropped from the waggoners' eyes, and they saw a man facing them.

Whether it was due to the flickering light or because everyone wanted to make out the man's face first of all, it happened, strangely enough, that at the first glance at him they all saw, first of all, not his face nor his clothes, but his smile. It was an extraordinarily good-natured, broad, soft smile, like that of a baby on waking, one of those infectious smiles to which it is difficult not to respond by smiling too. The stranger, when they did get a good look at him, turned out to be a man of thirty, ugly and in no way remarkable. He was a tall Little Russian, with a long nose, long arms and long legs; everything about him seemed long except his neck, which was so short that it made him seem stooping. He was wearing a clean white shirt with an embroidered collar, white trousers, and new high boots, and in comparison with the waggoners he looked quite a dandy. In his arms he was carrying something big, white, and at the first glance strange-looking, and the stock of a gun also peeped out from behind his shoulder.

Coming from the darkness into the circle of light, he stopped short as though petrified, and for half a minute looked at the waggoners as though <mention connection="s17113" id="s17192" speaker="Konstantin_Zvonik">he</mention> would have said: <quote connection="s17192" id="s17113" mention="organism777" oid="359" speaker="Konstantin_Zvonik">"Just look what a smile I have!"</quote>

Then <mention connection="s17194" id="s17193" speaker="Konstantin_Zvonik">he</mention> took a step towards the fire, smiled still more radiantly and said:

<quote connection="s17193" id="s17194" oid="360" speaker="Konstantin_Zvonik">"Bread and salt, friends!"</quote><quote connection="s18961" id="s20183" mention="named986" oid="361" speaker="Panteley">"You are very welcome!"</quote> <mention connection="s20183" entity="entity364" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s18961" mentiontype="name" oid="named986" speaker="Panteley">Panteley</mention> answered for them all.

<mention class="stranger" connection="s20185,s20187" entity="organism782" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s18962" mentiontype="nominal" modifier="" oid="organism782" speaker="Konstantin_Zvonik">The stranger</mention> put down by the fire what he was carrying in his arms --it was a dead bustard-- and greeted them once more.

They all went up to the bustard and began examining it.

<quote connection="s18966" id="s20184" mention="named987" oid="362" speaker="Dymov">"A fine big bird; what did you kill it with?"</quote> asked <mention connection="s20184,s20186" entity="entity420" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s18966" mentiontype="name" oid="named987" speaker="Dymov">Dymov</mention>.

<quote connection="s18962" id="s20185" mention="organism782" oid="363" speaker="Konstantin_Zvonik">"Grape-shot. You can't get him with small shot, he won't let you get near enough. Buy it, friends! I will let you have it for twenty kopecks."</quote>

<quote connection="s18966" id="s20186" mention="named987" oid="364" speaker="Dymov">"What use would it be to us? It's good roast, but I bet it would be tough boiled; you could not get your teeth into it. . . ."</quote>

<quote connection="s18962" id="s20187" mention="organism782" oid="365" speaker="Konstantin_Zvonik">"Oh, what a pity! I would take it to the gentry at the farm; they would give me half a rouble for it. But it's a long way to go-- twelve miles!"</quote>

The stranger sat down, took off his gun and laid it beside him.

He seemed sleepy and languid; he sat smiling, and, screwing up his eyes at the firelight, apparently thinking of something very agreeable. They gave him a spoon; he began eating.

<quote connection="s18972" id="s20188" mention="named991" oid="366" speaker="Dymov">"Who are you?"</quote> <mention connection="s20188" entity="entity420" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s18972" mentiontype="name" oid="named991" speaker="Dymov">Dymov</mention> asked him.

The stranger did not hear the question; he made no answer, and did not even glance at <mention>Dymov</mention>. Most likely this smiling man did not taste the flavour of the porridge either, for he seemed to eat it mechanically, lifting the spoon to his lips sometimes very full and sometimes quite empty. He was not drunk, but he seemed to have something nonsensical in his head.

<quote connection="s18976" id="s20189" mention="named993" oid="367" speaker="Dymov">"I ask you who you are?"</quote> repeated <mention connection="s20189,s20193" entity="entity420" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s18976" mentiontype="name" oid="named993" speaker="Dymov">Dymov</mention>.

And anxious to show straight off that he was not quite an ordinary peasant, but something better, <mention connection="s20192,s20194" entity="entity680" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s18982" mentiontype="name" oid="named998" speaker="Konstantin_Zvonik">Konstantin</mention> hastened to add:

<quote connection="s18976" id="s20193" oid="371" speaker="Dymov">"Do you live with your father or in a house of your own?"</quote>

<quote connection="s18982" id="s20194" mention="named998" oid="372" speaker="Konstantin_Zvonik">"No; now I am living in a house of my own. I have parted. This month, just after St. Peter's Day, I got married. I am a married man now! . . . It's eighteen days since the wedding."</quote>

<quote connection="s18989" id="s20195" mention="named1004" oid="373" speaker="Panteley">"That's a good thing,"</quote> said <mention connection="s20195,s20196" entity="entity364" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s18989" mentiontype="name" oid="named1004" speaker="Panteley">Panteley</mention>. <quote connection="s18989" id="s20196" mention="named1004" oid="374" speaker="Panteley">"Marriage is a good thing . . . .

<quote connection="s18992" id="s20197" mention="named1006" oid="375" speaker="Kiruha">"His young wife sits at home while he rambles about the steppe,"</quote> laughed <mention connection="s20197,s20198" entity="entity381" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s18992" mentiontype="name" oid="named1006" speaker="Kiruha">Kiruha</mention>. <quote connection="s18992" id="s20198" mention="named1006" oid="376" speaker="Kiruha">"Queer chap!"</quote>

As though he had been pinched on the tenderest spot, Konstantin started, laughed and flushed crimson.

<quote connection="s20249" id="s20199" mention="named1007" oid="377" speaker="Konstantin_Zvonik">"But, Lord, she is not at home!"</quote> <mention connection="s20199,s20200" id="s20249" speaker="Konstantin_Zvonik">he</mention> said quickly, taking the spoon out of his mouth and looking round at everyone with an expression of delight and wonder. <quote connection="s20249" id="s20200" mention="named1007" oid="378" speaker="Konstantin_Zvonik">"She is not; she has gone to her mother's for three days! Yes, indeed, she has gone away, and I feel as though I were not married. . . ."</quote>

Konstantin waved his hand and turned his head; he wanted to go on thinking, but the joy which beamed in his face prevented him. As though he were not comfortable, he changed his attitude, laughed, and again waved his hand. He was ashamed to share his happy thoughts with strangers, but at the same time he had an irresistible longing to communicate his joy.

<quote connection="s20250" id="s20201" mention="named1011" oid="379" speaker="Konstantin_Zvonik">"She has gone to Demidovo to see her mother,"</quote> <mention connection="s20201,s20202,s20204" id="s20250" speaker="Konstantin_Zvonik">he</mention> said, blushing and moving his gun. <quote connection="s20250" id="s20202" mention="named1011" oid="380" speaker="Konstantin_Zvonik">"She'll be back to-morrow. . . .

Konstantin rubbed his eyes, looked at the fire and laughed.

I was so frantic that I even wanted to get taken on as a labourer in Demidovo, so as to be near her. I was in misery! My mother called in a witch a dozen times; my father tried thrashing me. For three years I was in this torment, and then I made up my mind. <quote connection="s20253" id="s20247" speaker="Konstantin_Zvonik">'Damn my soul!'</quote> <mention connection="s20247,s20248" id="s20253" speaker="Konstantin_Zvonik">I</mention> said. <quote connection="s20253" id="s20248" speaker="Konstantin_Zvonik">'I will go to the town and be a cabman. . . .

Konstantin threw back his head and went off into a mirthful tinkling laugh, as though he had just taken <mention>someone</mention> in very cleverly.

<quote connection="s20256" id="s20212" mention="named1064" oid="390" speaker="Konstantin_Zvonik">"I saw her by the river with the lads,"</quote> <mention connection="s20212,s20213,s20215" id="s20256" speaker="Konstantin_Zvonik">he</mention> went on. <quote connection="s20256" id="s20213" mention="named1064" oid="391" speaker="Konstantin_Zvonik">"I was overcome with anger. . . .

<quote connection="s19076" id="s20214" mention="named1070" oid="392" speaker="Dymov">"What did you say to her?"</quote> asked <mention connection="s20214" entity="entity420" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s19076" mentiontype="name" oid="named1070" speaker="Dymov">Dymov</mention>.

<quote connection="s20256" id="s20215" mention="named1064" oid="393" speaker="Konstantin_Zvonik">"What did I say? I don't remember. . . How could one remember?

She's gone now to her mother's, the magpie, and while she is away here I wander over the steppe. I can't stay at home. It's more than I can do!"</quote>

Konstantin awkwardly released his feet, on which he was sitting, stretched himself on the earth, and propped his head in his fists, then got up and sat down again. Everyone by now thoroughly understood that he was in love and happy, poignantly happy; his smile, his eyes, and every movement, expressed fervent happiness. He could not find a place for himself, and did not know what attitude to take to keep himself from being overwhelmed by the multitude of his delightful thoughts. Having poured out his soul before these strangers, he settled down quietly at last, and, looking at the fire, sank into thought.

At the sight of this happy man everyone felt depressed and longed to be happy, too. Everyone was dreamy. <mention>Dymov</mention> got up, walked about softly by the fire, and from his walk, from the movement of his shoulder-blades, it could be seen that he was weighed down by depression and yearning. He stood still for a moment, looked at Konstantin and sat down.

The camp fire had died down by now; there was no flicker, and the patch of red had grown small and dim. . . . And as the fire went out the moonlight grew clearer and clearer. Now they could see the full width of the road, the bales of wool, the shafts of the waggons, the munching horses; on the further side of the road there was the dim outline of the second cross. . . .

<mention>Dymov</mention> leaned his cheek on his hand and softly hummed some plaintive song. Konstantin smiled drowsily and chimed in with a thin voice. They sang for half a minute, then sank into silence. <mention>Emelyan</mention> started, jerked his elbows and wriggled his fingers.

<quote connection="s20257" id="s20216" oid="394" speaker="Emelyan">"Lads,"</quote> <mention connection="s20216,s20217" id="s20257" speaker="Emelyan">he</mention> said in an imploring voice, <quote connection="s20257" id="s20217" oid="395" speaker="Emelyan">"let's sing something sacred!"</quote> Tears came into his eyes. <quote connection="s20258" id="s20218" oid="396" speaker="Emelyan">"Lads,"</quote> <mention connection="s20218,s20219" id="s20258" speaker="Emelyan">he</mention> repeated, pressing his hands on his heart, <quote connection="s20258" id="s20219" oid="397" speaker="Emelyan">"let's sing something sacred!"</quote>

<quote connection="s19097" id="s20220" mention="named1083" oid="398" speaker="Konstantin_Zvonik">"I don't know anything,"</quote> said <mention connection="s20220" entity="entity680" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s19097" mentiontype="name" oid="named1083" speaker="Konstantin_Zvonik">Konstantin</mention>.

Everyone refused, then <mention>Emelyan</mention> sang alone. He waved both arms, nodded his head, opened his mouth, but nothing came from his throat but a discordant gasp. He sang with his arms, with his head, with his eyes, even with the swelling on his face; he sang passionately with anguish, and the more he strained his chest to extract at least one note from it, the more discordant were his gasps.

<mention>Yegorushka</mention>, like the rest, was overcome with depression. He went to his waggon, clambered up on the bales and lay down. He looked at the sky, and thought of happy Konstantin and his wife. Why did people get married? What were women in the world for? <mention>Yegorushka</mention> put the vague questions to himself, and thought that a man would certainly be happy if he had an affectionate, merry and beautiful woman continually living at his side. For some reason he remembered the Countess Dranitsky, and thought it would probably be very pleasant to live with a woman like that; he would perhaps have married her with pleasure if that idea had not been so shameful. He recalled her eyebrows, the pupils of her eyes, her carriage, the clock with the horseman. . . . The soft warm night moved softly down upon him and whispered something in his ear, and it seemed to him that it was that lovely woman bending over him, looking at him with a smile and meaning to kiss him. . . .

Nothing was left of the fire but two little red eyes, which kept on growing smaller and smaller. Konstantin and the waggoners were sitting by it, dark motionless figures, and it seemed as though there were many more of them than before. The twin crosses were equally visible, and far, far away, somewhere by the highroad there gleamed a red light-- other people cooking their porridge, most likely.

<quote connection="s19115" id="s20221" mention="named1092" oid="399" speaker="Kiruha">"Our Mother Russia is the he-ad of all the world!"</quote> <mention connection="s20221" entity="entity381" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s19115" mentiontype="name" oid="named1092" speaker="Kiruha">Kiruha</mention> sang out suddenly in a harsh voice, choked and subsided. The steppe echo caught up his voice, carried it on, and it seemed as though stupidity itself were rolling on heavy wheels over the steppe.

<quote connection="s19118" id="s20222" mention="named1093" oid="400" speaker="Panteley">"It's time to go,"</quote> said <mention connection="s20222,s20223" entity="entity364" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s19118" mentiontype="name" oid="named1093" speaker="Panteley">Panteley</mention>. <quote connection="s19118" id="s20223" mention="named1093" oid="401" speaker="Panteley">"Get up, lads."</quote>

While they were putting the horses in, Konstantin walked by the waggons and talked rapturously of his wife.

<quote connection="s20259" id="s20224" mention="named1094" oid="402" speaker="Konstantin_Zvonik">"Good-bye, mates!"</quote> <mention connection="s20224,s20225" id="s20259" speaker="Konstantin_Zvonik">he</mention> cried when the waggons started. <quote connection="s20259" id="s20225" mention="named1094" oid="403" speaker="Konstantin_Zvonik">"Thank you for your hospitality. I shall go on again towards that light. It's more than I can stand."</quote>

And he quickly vanished in the mist, and for a long time they could hear him striding in the direction of the light to tell those other strangers of his happiness.

When <mention>Yegorushka</mention> woke up next day it was early morning; the sun had not yet risen. The waggons were at a standstill. A man in a white cap and a suit of cheap grey material, mounted on a little Cossack stallion, was talking to <mention>Dymov</mention> and <mention>Kiruha</mention> beside the foremost waggon. A mile and a half ahead there were long low white barns and little houses with tiled roofs; there were neither yards nor trees to be seen beside the little houses.

<quote connection="s19131" id="s20226" mention="named1101" oid="404" speaker="Yegorushka">"What village is that, Grandfather?"</quote> asked <mention connection="s20226" entity="entity11" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s19131" mentiontype="name" oid="named1101" speaker="Yegorushka">Yegorushka</mention>.

<quote connection="s19132" id="s20227" mention="named1102" oid="405" speaker="Panteley">"That's the Armenian Settlement, youngster,"</quote> answered <mention connection="s20227,s20228" entity="entity364" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s19132" mentiontype="name" oid="named1102" speaker="Panteley">Panteley</mention>. <quote connection="s19132" id="s20228" mention="named1102" oid="406" speaker="Panteley">"The Armenians live there. They are a good sort of people, . . . the Arnienians are."</quote>

The man in grey had finished talking to <mention>Dymov</mention> and <mention>Kiruha</mention>; he pulled up his little stallion and looked across towards the settlement.

<quote connection="s19139" id="s20229" mention="named1105" oid="407" speaker="Panteley">"What a business, only think!"</quote> sighed <mention connection="s20229,s20230,s20232" entity="entity364" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s19139" mentiontype="name" oid="named1105" speaker="Panteley">Panteley</mention>, looking towards the settlement, too, and shuddering at the morning freshness. <quote connection="s19139" id="s20230" mention="named1105" oid="408" speaker="Panteley">"He has sent a man to the settlement for some papers, and he doesn't come . . . . He should have sent <mention>Styopka</mention>."</quote>

<quote connection="s19143" id="s20231" mention="named1108" oid="409" speaker="Yegorushka">"Who is that, Grandfather?"</quote> asked <mention connection="s20231" entity="entity11" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s19143" mentiontype="name" oid="named1108" speaker="Yegorushka">Yegorushka</mention>.

<quote connection="s19139" id="s20232" oid="410" speaker="Panteley">"Varlamov."</quote>

My goodness! <mention>Yegorushka</mention> jumped up quickly, getting upon his knees, and looked at the white cap. It was hard to recognize the mysterious elusive <mention>Varlamov</mention>, who was sought by everyone, who was always <quote connection="" id="s20233" oid="411" speaker="none">"on his rounds,"</quote> and who had far more money than <mention>Countess Dranitsky</mention>, in the short, grey little man in big boots, who was sitting on an ugly little nag and talking to peasants at an hour when all decent people were asleep.

<quote connection="s20261" id="s20234" oid="412" speaker="Panteley">"He is all right, a good man,"</quote> said <mention connection="s20234,s20235" id="s20261" speaker="Panteley">Panteley</mention>, looking towards the settlement. <quote connection="s20261" id="s20235" oid="413" speaker="Panteley">"God give him health -- a splendid gentleman, Semyon Alexandritch. . . . It's people like that the earth rests upon. That's true. . . . The cocks are not crowing yet, and he is already up and about. . . . Another man would be asleep, or gallivanting with visitors at home, but he is on the steppe all day, . . . on his rounds. . . . He does not let things slip. . . . No-o! He's a fine fellow. . ."</quote>

Varlamov was talking about something, while he kept his eyes fixed. The little stallion shifted from one leg to another impatiently.

<quote connection="s20262" id="s20236" oid="414" speaker="Panteley">"Semyon Alexandritch!"</quote> cried <mention connection="s20236,s20237" id="s20262" speaker="Panteley">Panteley</mention>, taking off his hat. <quote connection="s20262" id="s20237" oid="415" speaker="Panteley">"Allow us to send <mention>Styopka</mention>! Emelyan, call out that <mention>Styopka</mention> should be sent."</quote>

But now at last a man on horseback could be seen coming from the settlement. Bending very much to one side and brandishing his whip above his head like a gallant young Caucasian, and wanting to astonish everyone by his horsemanship, he flew towards the waggons with the swiftness of a bird.

<quote connection="s20263" id="s20265" speaker="Panteley">"That must be one of his circuit men,"</quote> said <mention connection="s20265,s20239" id="s20263" speaker="Panteley">Panteley</mention>. <quote connection="s20263" id="s20239" oid="417" speaker="Panteley">"He must have a hundred such horsemen or maybe more."</quote>

Reaching the first waggon, he pulled up his horse, and taking off his hat, handed <mention>Varlamov</mention> a little book. <mention connection="s20240" id="s20266" speaker="Varlamov">Varlamov</mention> took several papers out of the book, read them and cried:

<quote connection="s20266" id="s20240" oid="418" speaker="Varlamov">"And where is Ivantchuk's letter?"</quote>

The horseman took the book back, looked at the papers and shrugged his shoulders. He began saying something, probably justifying himself and asking to be allowed to ride back to the settlement again. The little stallion suddenly stirred as though <mention>Varlamov</mention> had grown heavier. <mention>Varlamov</mention> stirred too.

<quote connection="s20267" id="s20241" oid="419" speaker="Varlamov">"Go along!"</quote> <mention connection="s20241" id="s20267" speaker="Varlamov">he</mention> cried angrily, and he waved his whip at <mention>the man</mention>.

Then he turned his horse round and, looking through the papers in the book, moved at a walking pace alongside the waggons. When he reached the hindmost, <mention>Yegorushka</mention> strained his eyes to get a better look at him. <mention>Varlamov</mention> was an elderly man. His face, a simple Russian sunburnt face with a small grey beard, was red, wet with dew and covered with little blue veins; it had the same expression of businesslike coldness as Ivan Ivanitch's face, the same look of fanatical zeal for business. But yet what a difference could be felt between him and Kuzmitchov! Uncle Ivan Ivanitch always had on his face, together with his business-like reserve, a look of anxiety and apprehension that he would not find <mention>Varlamov</mention>, that he would be late, that he would miss a good price; nothing of that sort, so characteristic of small and dependent persons, could be seen in the face or figure of <mention>Varlamov</mention>. This man made the price himself, was not looking for <mention>anyone</mention>, and did not depend on <mention>anyone</mention>; however ordinary his exterior, yet in everything, even in the manner of holding his whip, there was a sense of power and habitual authority over the steppe.

As he rode by <mention>Yegorushka</mention> he did not glance at him. Only the little stallion deigned to notice <mention>Yegorushka</mention>; he looked at him with his large foolish eyes, and even he showed no interest. <mention>Panteley</mention> bowed to <mention connection="s20242" id="s20268" speaker="Varlamov">Varlamov</mention>; the latter noticed it, and without taking his eyes off the sheets of paper, said lisping:

<quote connection="s20268" id="s20242" oid="420" speaker="Varlamov">"How are you, old man?"</quote>

Varlamov's conversation with the horseman and the way he had brandished his whip had evidently made an overwhelming impression on the whole party. Everyone looked grave. The man on horseback, cast down at the anger of the great man, remained stationary, with his hat off, and the rein loose by the foremost waggon; he was silent, and seemed unable to grasp that the day had begun so badly for him.

<quote connection="s20269" id="s20243" oid="421" speaker="Panteley">"He is a harsh old man, . ."</quote> muttered <mention connection="s20243,s20244" id="s20269" speaker="Panteley">Panteley</mention>. <quote connection="s20269" id="s20244" oid="422" speaker="Panteley">"It's a pity he is so harsh! But he is all right, a good man. . . . He doesn't abuse men for nothing. . . . It's no matter. . . ."</quote>

After examining the papers, <mention>Varlamov</mention> thrust the book into his pocket; the little stallion, as though he knew what was in his mind, without waiting for orders, started and dashed along the highroad.</chapter><chapter>VII

On the following night the waggoners had halted and were cooking their porridge. On this occasion there was a sense of overwhelming oppression over everyone. It was sultry; they all drank a great deal, but could not quench their thirst. The moon was intensely crimson and sullen, as though it were sick. The stars, too, were sullen, the mist was thicker, the distance more clouded. Nature seemed as though languid and weighed down by some foreboding.

There was not the same liveliness and talk round the camp fire as there had been the day before. All were dreary and spoke listlessly and without interest. <mention>Panteley</mention> did nothing but sigh and complain of his feet, and continually alluded to impenitent deathbeds.

<mention>Dymov</mention> was lying on his stomach, chewing a straw in silence; there was an expression of disgust on his face as though the straw smelt unpleasant, a spiteful and exhausted look. . . . <mention>Vassya</mention> complained that his jaw ached, and prophesied bad weather; <mention>Emelyan</mention> was not waving his arms, but sitting still and looking gloomily at the fire. <mention>Yegorushka</mention>, too, was weary. This slow travelling exhausted him, and the sultriness of the day had given him a headache.

While they were cooking the porridge, <mention>Dymov</mention>, to relieve his boredom, began quarrelling with his companions.

<quote connection="s23467" id="s23372" oid="423" speaker="Dymov">"Here he lolls, the lumpy face, and is the first to put his spoon in,"</quote> <mention connection="s23372,s23373" id="s23467" speaker="Dymov">he</mention> said, looking spitefully at <mention>Emelyan</mention>. <quote connection="s23467" id="s23373" oid="424" speaker="Dymov">"Greedy! always contrives to sit next the cauldron. He's been a church-singer, so he thinks he is a gentleman! There are a lot of singers like you begging along the highroad!"</quote>

<quote connection="s23468" id="s23374" oid="425" speaker="Emelyan">"What are you pestering me for?"</quote> asked <mention connection="s23374" id="s23468" speaker="Emelyan">Emelyan</mention>, looking at <mention connection="s23375" id="s23469" speaker="Dymov">him</mention> angrily.

<quote connection="s23469" id="s23375" oid="426" speaker="Dymov">"To teach you not to be the first to dip into the cauldron. Don't think too much of yourself!"</quote>

<quote connection="s23470" id="s23376" oid="427" speaker="Emelyan">"You are a fool, and that is all about it!"</quote> wheezed out <mention connection="s23376" id="s23470" speaker="Emelyan">Emelyan</mention>.

Knowing by experience how such conversations usually ended, <mention>Panteley</mention> and <mention>Vassya</mention> intervened and tried to persuade <mention>Dymov</mention> not to quarrel about nothing.

<quote connection="s23471" id="s23377" oid="428" speaker="Dymov">"A church-singer!"</quote> <mention connection="s23377,s23378" id="s23471" speaker="Dymov">The bully</mention> would not desist, but laughed contemptuously. <quote connection="s23471" id="s23378" oid="429" speaker="Dymov">"<mention connection="s23379" id="s23472" speaker="anyone">Anyone</mention> can sing like that-- sit in the church porch and sing <quote connection="s23472" id="s23379" oid="" speaker="anyone">'Give me alms, for Christ's sake!'</quote> Ugh! you are a nice fellow!"</quote>

Emelyan did not speak. His silence had an irritating effect on <mention>Dymov</mention>. <mention connection="s23380" id="s23473" speaker="Dymov">He</mention> looked with still greater hatred at the ex-singer and said:

<quote connection="s23473" id="s23380" oid="430" speaker="Dymov">"I don't care to have anything to do with you, or I would show you what to think of yourself."</quote>

<quote connection="s23474" id="s23381" oid="431" speaker="Emelyan">"But why are you pushing me, you Mazeppa?"</quote> <mention connection="s23381,s23382" id="s23474" speaker="Emelyan">Emelyan</mention> cried, flaring up. <quote connection="s23474" id="s23382" oid="432" speaker="Emelyan">"Am I interfering with you?"</quote>

<quote connection="s23475" id="s23383" oid="433" speaker="Dymov">"What did you call me?"</quote> asked <mention connection="s23383,s23384" id="s23475" speaker="Dymov">Dymov</mention>, drawing himself up, and his eyes were suffused with blood. <quote connection="s23475" id="s23384" oid="434" speaker="Dymov">"Eh! I am a Mazeppa? Yes? Take that, then; go and look for it."</quote>

Dymov snatched the spoon out of Emelyan's hand and flung it far away. <mention>Kiruha</mention>, <mention>Vassya</mention>, and <mention>Styopka</mention> ran to look for it, while <mention>Emelyan</mention> fixed an imploring and questioning look on <mention>Panteley</mention>. His face suddenly became small and wrinkled; it began twitching, and the ex-singer began to cry like a child.

<mention>Yegorushka</mention>, who had long hated <mention>Dymov</mention>, felt as though the air all at once were unbearably stifling, as though the fire were scorching his face; he longed to run quickly to the waggons in the darkness, but the bully's angry bored eyes drew the boy to him. With a passionate desire to say something extremely offensive, <mention connection="s23385" id="s23476" speaker="Yegorushka">he </mention>took a step towards <mention>Dymov</mention> and brought out, gasping for breath:

<quote connection="s23476" id="s23385" oid="435" speaker="Yegorushka">"You are the worst of the lot; I can't bear you!"</quote>

After this he ought to have run to the waggons, but <mention connection="s23386" id="s23477" speaker="Yegorushka">he</mention> could not stir from the spot and went on:

<quote connection="s23477" id="s23386" oid="436" speaker="Yegorushka">"In the next world you will burn in hell! I'll complain to <mention>Ivan Ivanitch</mention>. Don't you dare insult Emelyan!"</quote>

<quote connection="s23478" id="s23387" oid="437" speaker="Dymov">"Say this too, please,"</quote> laughed <mention connection="s23388,s23389,s23387" id="s23478" speaker="Dymov">Dyrnov</mention>: <quote connection="s23478" id="s23388" oid="438" speaker="Dymov">"<quote connection="s23478" id="s23389" oid="" speaker="Dymov">'every little sucking-pig wants to lay down the law.'</quote> Shall I pull your ear?"</quote>

Yegorushka felt that he could not breathe; and something which had never happened to him before-- <mention connection="s23390" id="s23479" speaker="Yegorushka">he</mention> suddenly began shaking all over, stamping his feet and crying shrilly:

<quote connection="s23479" id="s23390" oid="439" speaker="Yegorushka">"Beat him, beat him!"</quote>

Tears gushed from his eyes; he felt ashamed, and ran staggering back to the waggon. The effect produced by his outburst he did not see. Lying on the bales and twitching his arms and legs, <mention connection="s23391" id="s23480" speaker="Yegorushka">he</mention> whispered:

<quote connection="s23480" id="s23391" oid="440" speaker="Yegorushka">"Mother, mother!"</quote>

And these men and the shadows round the camp fire, and the dark bales and the far-away lightning, which was flashing every minute in the distance-- all struck him now as terrible and unfriendly. He was overcome with terror and asked himself in despair why and how he had come into this unknown land in the company of terrible peasants? Where was his uncle now, where was <mention>Father Christopher</mention>, where was <mention>Deniska</mention>? Why were they so long in coming? Hadn't they forgotten him? At the thought that he was forgotten and cast out to the mercy of fate, he felt such a cold chill of dread that he had several times an impulse to jump off the bales of wool, and run back full speed along the road; but the thought of the huge dark crosses, which would certainly meet him on the way, and the lightning flashing in the distance, stopped him. . . . And only when <mention connection="s23392" id="s23481" speaker="Yegorushka">he</mention> whispered, <quote connection="s23481" id="s23392" oid="441" speaker="Yegorushka">"Mother, mother!"</quote> he felt as it were a little better.

The waggoners must have been full of dread, too. After <mention>Yegorushka</mention> had run away from the camp fire they sat at first for a long time in silence, then they began speaking in hollow undertones about something, saying that it was coming and that they must make haste and get away from it. . . . They quickly finished supper, put out the fire and began harnessing the horses in silence. From their fluster and the broken phrases they uttered it was apparent they foresaw some trouble. Before they set off on their way, <mention connection="s23393" id="s23482" speaker="Dymov">Dymov</mention> went up to <mention>Panteley</mention> and asked softly:

<quote connection="s23482" id="s23393" oid="442" speaker="Dymov">"What's his name?"</quote>

<quote connection="s23483" id="s23394" oid="443" speaker="Panteley">"Yegory,"</quote> answered <mention connection="s23394" id="s23483" speaker="Panteley">Panteley</mention>.

<mention>Dymov</mention> put one foot on the wheel, caught hold of the cord which was tied round the bales and pulled himself up. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> saw his face and curly head. The face was pale and looked grave and exhausted, but there was no expression of spite in it.

<quote connection="s23484" id="s23395" oid="444" speaker="Dymov">"Yera!"</quote> <mention connection="s23395,s23396" id="s23484" speaker="Dymov">he</mention> said softly, <quote connection="s23484" id="s23396" oid="445" speaker="Dymov">"here, hit me!"</quote>

Yegorushka looked at him in surprise. At that instant there was a flash of lightning.

<quote connection="s23485" id="s23397" oid="446" speaker="Dymov">"It's all right, hit me,"</quote> repeated <mention connection="s23397" id="s23485" speaker="Dymov">Dymov</mention>. And without waiting for <mention>Yegorushka</mention> to hit him or to speak to him, <mention connection="s23398" id="s23486" speaker="Dymov">he</mention> jumped down and said: <quote connection="s23486" id="s23398" oid="447" speaker="Dymov">"How dreary I am!"</quote>

Then, swaying from one leg to the other and moving his shoulder-blades, he sauntered lazily alongside the string of waggons and repeated in a voice half weeping, half angry:

<quote connection="s23487" id="s23399" oid="448" speaker="Dymov">"How dreary I am! O Lord! Don't you take offence, <mention>Emelyan</mention>,"</quote> <mention connection="s23399,s23400" id="s23487" speaker="Dymov">he</mention> said as he passed <mention>Emelyan</mention>. <quote connection="s23487" id="s23400" oid="449" speaker="Dymov">"Ours is a wretched cruel life!"</quote>

There was a flash of lightning on the right, and, like a reflection in the looking-glass, at once a second flash in the distance.

<quote connection="s23488" id="s23401" oid="450" speaker="Panteley">"Yegory, take this,"</quote> cried <mention connection="s23401,s23403" id="s23488" speaker="Panteley">Panteley</mention>, throwing up something big and dark.

<quote connection="s23489" id="s23402" oid="451" speaker="Yegorushka">"What is it?"</quote> asked <mention connection="s23402" id="s23489" speaker="Yegorushka">Yegorushka</mention>.

<quote connection="s23488" id="s23403" oid="452" speaker="Panteley">"A mat. There will be rain, so cover yourself up."</quote>

Yegorushka sat up and looked about him. The distance had grown perceptibly blacker, and now oftener than every minute winked with a pale light. The blackness was being bent towards the right as though by its own weight.

<quote connection="s23490" id="s23404" oid="453" speaker="Yegorushka">"Will there be a storm, Grandfather?"</quote> asked <mention connection="s23404" id="s23490" speaker="Yegorushka">Yegorushka</mention>.

<quote connection="s23491" id="s23405" oid="454" speaker="Panteley">"Ah, my poor feet, how they ache!"</quote> <mention connection="s23405" id="s23491" speaker="Panteley">Panteley</mention> said in a high-pitched voice, stamping his feet and not hearing the boy.

On the left <mention>someone</mention> seemed to strike a match in the sky; a pale phosphorescent streak gleamed and went out. There was a sound as though <mention>someone</mention> very far away were walking over an iron roof, probably barefoot, for the iron gave a hollow rumble.

<quote connection="s23492" id="s23406" oid="455" speaker="Kiruha">"It's set in!"</quote> cried <mention connection="s23406" id="s23492" speaker="Kiruha">Kiruha</mention>.

Between the distance and the horizon on the right there was a flash of lightning so vivid that it lighted up part of the steppe and the spot where the clear sky met the blackness. A terrible cloud was swooping down, without haste, a compact mass; big black shreds hung from its edge; similar shreds pressing one upon another were piling up on the right and left horizon. The tattered, ragged look of the storm-cloud gave it a drunken disorderly air. There was a distinct, not smothered, growl of thunder. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> crossed himself and began quickly putting on his great-coat.

<quote connection="s23493" id="s23407" oid="456" speaker="Dymov">"I am dreary!"</quote> <mention connection="s23407,s23408" id="s23493" speaker="Dymov">Dymov</mention>'s shout floated from the foremost waggon, and it could be told from his voice that he was beginning to be ill-humoured again. <quote connection="s23493" id="s23408" oid="457" speaker="Dymov">"I am so dreary!"</quote>

All at once there was a squall of wind, so violent that it almost snatched away Yegorushka's bundle and mat; the mat fluttered in all directions and flapped on the bale and on Yegorushka's face. The wind dashed whistling over the steppe, whirled round in disorder and raised such an uproar from the grass that neither the thunder nor the creaking of the wheels could be heard; it blew from the black storm-cloud, carrying with it clouds of dust and the scent of rain and wet earth. The moonlight grew mistier, as it were dirtier; the stars were even more overcast; and clouds of dust could be seen hurrying along the edge of the road, followed by their shadows. By now, most likely, the whirlwind eddying round and lifting from the earth dust, dry grass and feathers, was mounting to the very sky; uprooted plants must have been flying by that very black storm-cloud, and how frightened they must have been! But through the dust that clogged the eyes nothing could be seen but the flash of lightning.

<mention>Yegorushka</mention>, thinking it would pour with rain in a minute, knelt up and covered himself with the mat.

<quote connection="s23497" id="s23531" speaker="someone">"Panteley-ey!"</quote> <mention connection="s23410,s23531" id="s23497" speaker="someone">someone</mention> shouted in the front. <quote connection="s23497" id="s23410" oid="459" speaker="someone">"A. . . a. . . va!"</quote>

<quote connection="s23494" id="s23411" oid="460" speaker="Panteley">"I can't!"</quote> <mention connection="s23411,s23412" id="s23494" speaker="Panteley">Panteley</mention> answered in a loud high voice. <quote connection="s23494" id="s23412" oid="461" speaker="Panteley">"A . . . a . . . va! Arya . . . a!"</quote>

There was an angry clap of thunder, which rolled across the sky from right to left, then back again, and died away near the foremost waggon.

<quote connection="s23495" id="s23413" oid="462" speaker="Yegorushka">"Holy, holy, holy, Lord of Sabaoth,"</quote> whispered <mention connection="s23413,s23414" id="s23495" speaker="Yegorushka">Yegorushka</mention>, crossing himself. <quote connection="s23495" id="s23414" oid="463" speaker="Yegorushka">"Fill heaven and earth with Thy glory."</quote>

The blackness in the sky yawned wide and breathed white fire. At once there was another clap of thunder. It had scarcely ceased when there was a flash of lightning so broad that <mention>Yegorushka</mention> suddenly saw through a slit in the mat the whole highroad to the very horizon, all the waggoners and even Kiruha's waistcoat. The black shreds had by now moved upwards from the left, and one of them, a coarse, clumsy monster like a claw with fingers, stretched to the moon. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> made up his mind to shut his eyes tight, to pay no attention to it, and to wait till it was all over.

The rain was for some reason long in coming. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> peeped out from the mat in the hope that perhaps the storm-cloud was passing over. It was fearfully dark. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> could see neither Panteley, nor the bale of wool, nor himself; he looked sideways towards the place where the moon had lately been, but there was the same black darkness there as over the waggons. And in the darkness the flashes of lightning seemed more violent and blinding, so that they hurt his eyes.

<quote connection="s23496" id="s23415" oid="464" speaker="Yegorushka">"Panteley!"</quote> called <mention connection="s23415" id="s23496" speaker="Yegorushka">Yegorushka</mention>.

No answer followed. But now a gust of wind for the last time flung up the mat and hurried away. A quiet regular sound was heard. A big cold drop fell on Yegorushka's knee, another trickled over his hand. He noticed that his knees were not covered, and tried to rearrange the mat, but at that moment something began pattering on the road, then on the shafts and the bales. It was the rain. As though they understood one another, the rain and the mat began prattling of something rapidly, gaily and most annoyingly like two magpies.

<mention>Yegorushka</mention> knelt up or rather squatted on his boots. While the rain was pattering on the mat, he leaned forward to screen his knees, which were suddenly wet. He succeeded in covering his knees, but in less than a minute was aware of a penetrating, unpleasant dampness behind on his back and the calves of his legs. He returned to his former position, exposing his knees to the rain, and wondered what to do to rearrange the mat which he could not see in the darkness. But his arms were already wet, the water was trickling up his sleeves and down his collar, and his shoulder-blades felt chilly. And he made up his mind to do nothing but sit motionless and wait till it was all over.

<quote connection="s23498" id="s23416" oid="465" speaker="Yegorushka">"Holy, holy, holy!"</quote> <mention connection="s23416" id="s23498" speaker="Yegorushka">he</mention> whispered.

Suddenly, exactly over his head, the sky cracked with a fearful deafening din; he huddled up and held his breath, waiting for the fragments to fall upon his head and back. He inadvertently opened his eyes and saw a blinding intense light flare out and flash five times on his fingers, his wet sleeves, and on the trickles of water running from the mat upon the bales and down to the ground. There was a fresh peal of thunder as violent and awful; the sky was not growling and rumbling now, but uttering short crashing sounds like the crackling of dry wood.

<quote connection="s23499" id="s23417" oid="466" speaker="the_thunder">"Trrah! tah! tah! tah!"</quote> <mention connection="s23417,s23418,s23500,s23420" id="s23499" speaker="the_thunder">the thunder</mention> rang out distinctly, rolled over the sky, seemed to stumble, and somewhere by the foremost waggons or far behind to fall with an abrupt angry <quote connection="s23499" id="s23418" oid="467" speaker="the_thunder">"Trrra!"</quote>

The flashes of lightning had at first been only terrible, but with such thunder they seemed sinister and menacing. Their magic light pierced through closed eyelids and sent a chill all over the body. What could he do not to see them? <mention>Yegorushka</mention> made up his mind to turn over on his face. Cautiously, as though afraid of being watched, he got on all fours, and his hands slipping on the wet bale, he turned back again.

<quote connection="s23499" id="s23500" speaker="the_thunder">"Trrah! tah! tah!"</quote> floated over his head, rolled under the waggons and exploded <quote connection="s23499" id="s23420" oid="469" speaker="the_thunder">"Kraa!"</quote>

Again he inadvertently opened his eyes and saw a new danger: three huge giants with long pikes were following the waggon! A flash of lightning gleamed on the points of their pikes and lighted up their figures very distinctly. They were men of huge proportions, with covered faces, bowed heads, and heavy footsteps. They seemed gloomy and dispirited and lost in thought. Perhaps they were not following the waggons with any harmful intent, and yet there was something awful in their proximity.

<mention connection="s23421" id="s23501" speaker="Yegorushka">Yegorushka</mention> turned quickly forward, and trembling all over cried: <quote connection="s23501" id="s23421" oid="470" speaker="Yegorushka">"Panteley! Grandfather!"</quote>

<quote connection="s23502" id="s23422" oid="471" speaker="the_thunder">"Trrah! tah! tah!"</quote> <mention connection="s23422" id="s23502" speaker="the_thunder">the sky</mention> answered him.

He opened his eyes to see if the waggoners were there. There were flashes of lightning in two places, which lighted up the road to the far distance, the whole string of waggons and all the waggoners. Streams of water were flowing along the road and bubbles were dancing. <mention>Panteley</mention> was walking beside the waggon; his tall hat and his shoulder were covered with a small mat; his figure expressed neither terror nor uneasiness, as though he were deafened by <mention>the thunder</mention> and blinded by the lightning.

<quote connection="s23503" id="s23423" oid="472" speaker="Yegorushka">"Grandfather, the giants!"</quote> <mention connection="s23423" id="s23503" speaker="Yegorushka">Yegorushka</mention> shouted to him in tears.

But the old man did not hear. Further away walked <mention>Emelyan</mention>. He was covered from head to foot with a big mat and was triangular in shape. <mention>Vassya</mention>, without anything over him, was walking with the same wooden step as usual, lifting his feet high and not bending his knees. In the flash of lightning it seemed as though the waggons were not moving and the men were motionless, that Vassya's lifted foot was rigid in the same position. . . .

<mention>Yegorushka</mention> called the old man once more. Getting no answer, he sat motionless, and no longer waited for it all to end. He was convinced that <mention>the thunder</mention> would kill him in another minute, that he would accidentally open his eyes and see the terrible giants, and he left off crossing himself, calling the old man and thinking of his mother, and was simply numb with cold and the conviction that the storm would never end.

But at last there was <mention>the sound</mention> of voices.

<quote connection="s23504" id="s23424" oid="473" speaker="Panteley">"Yegory, are you asleep?"</quote> <mention connection="s23424,s23425" id="s23504" speaker="Panteley">Panteley</mention> cried below. <quote connection="s23504" id="s23425" oid="474" speaker="Panteley">"Get down! Is he deaf, the silly little thing? . . ."</quote>

<quote connection="s23522" id="s23426" oid="475" speaker="the_stranger">"Something like a storm!"</quote> said <mention connection="s23426" id="s23522" speaker="the_stranger">an unfamiliar bass voice</mention>, and <mention>the stranger</mention> cleared his throat as though he had just tossed off a good glass of vodka.

<mention>Yegorushka</mention> opened his eyes. Close to the waggon stood <mention>Panteley</mention>, <mention>Emelyan</mention>, looking like a triangle, and the giants. The latter were by now much shorter, and when <mention>Yegorushka</mention> looked more closely at them they turned out to be ordinary peasants, carrying on their shoulders not pikes but pitchforks. In the space between <mention>Panteley</mention> and the triangular figure, gleamed the window of a low-pitched hut. So the waggons were halting in the village. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> flung off the mat, took his bundle and made haste to get off the waggon. Now when close to him there were people talking and a lighted window he no longer felt afraid, though <mention>the thunder</mention> was crashing as before and the whole sky was streaked with lightning.

<quote connection="s23505" id="s23427" oid="476" speaker="Panteley">"It was a good storm, all right, . . ."</quote> <mention connection="s23427,s23428" id="s23505" speaker="Panteley">Panteley</mention> was muttering. <quote connection="s23505" id="s23428" oid="477" speaker="Panteley">"Thank God, . . . my feet are a little softened by the rain. It was all right. . . . Have you got down, Yegory? Well, go into the hut; it is all right. . . ."</quote>

<quote connection="s23506" id="s23429" oid="478" speaker="Emelyan">"Holy, holy, holy!"</quote> wheezed <mention connection="s23429,s23432" id="s23506" speaker="Emelyan">Emelyan</mention>, <quote connection="s23507" id="s23430" oid="479" speaker="Emelyan">"it must have struck something . . . . Are you of these parts?"</quote> <mention connection="s23430" id="s23507" speaker="Emelyan">he</mention> asked <mention connection="s23431,s23433" id="s23521" speaker="the_peasants">the giants</mention>.

<quote connection="s23521" id="s23431" oid="480" speaker="the_peasants">"No, from Glinovo. We belong to Glinovo. We are working at the Platers'."</quote>

<quote connection="s23506" id="s23432" oid="481" speaker="Emelyan">"Threshing?"</quote>

<quote connection="s23521" id="s23433" oid="482" speaker="the_peasants">"All sorts. Just now we are getting in the wheat. The lightning, the lightning! It is long since we have had such a storm. . . ."</quote>

Yegorushka went into the hut. He was met by a lean hunchbacked old woman with a sharp chin. She stood holding a tallow candle in her hands, screwing up her eyes and heaving prolonged sighs.

<quote connection="s23516" id="s23434" oid="483" speaker="the_old_woman">"What a storm God has sent us!"</quote> <mention connection="s23434,s23435" id="s23516" speaker="the_old_woman">she</mention> said. <quote connection="s23516" id="s23435" oid="484" speaker="the_old_woman">"And our lads are out for the night on the steppe; they'll have a bad time, poor dears! Take off your things, little sir, take off your things."</quote>

Shivering with cold and shrugging squeamishly, <mention>Yegorushka</mention> pulled off his drenched overcoat, then stretched out his arms and straddled his legs, and stood a long time without moving. The slightest movement caused an unpleasant sensation of cold and wetness. His sleeves and the back of his shirt were sopped, his trousers stuck to his legs, his head was dripping.

<quote connection="s23517" id="s23436" oid="485" speaker="the_old_woman">"What's the use of standing there, with your legs apart, little lad?"</quote> said <mention connection="s23436,s23437" id="s23517" speaker="the_old_woman">the old woman</mention>. <quote connection="s23517" id="s23437" oid="486" speaker="the_old_woman">"Come, sit down."</quote>

Holding his legs wide apart, <mention>Yegorushka</mention> went up to the table and sat down on a bench near somebody's head. The head moved, puffed a stream of air through its nose, made a chewing sound and subsided. A mound covered with a sheepskin stretched from the head along the bench; it was <mention>a peasant woman</mention> asleep.

The old woman went out sighing, and came back with a big water melon and a little sweet melon.

<quote connection="s23518" id="s23438" oid="487" speaker="the_old_woman">"Have something to eat, my dear! I have nothing else to offer you, . . ."</quote> <mention connection="s23438,s23439" id="s23518" speaker="the_old_woman">she</mention> said, yawning. She rummaged in the table and took out a long sharp knife, very much like the one with which the brigands killed the merchants in the inn. <quote connection="s23518" id="s23439" oid="488" speaker="the_old_woman">"Have some, my dear!"</quote>

Yegorushka, shivering as though he were in a fever, ate a slice of sweet melon with black bread and then a slice of water melon, and that made him feel colder still.

<quote connection="s23519" id="s23440" oid="489" speaker="the_old_woman">"Our lads are out on the steppe for the night, . . ."</quote> sighed <mention connection="s23440,s23441" id="s23519" speaker="the_old_woman">the old woman</mention> while he was eating. <quote connection="s23519" id="s23441" oid="490" speaker="the_old_woman">"The terror of the Lord! I'd light the candle under the ikon, but I don't know where Stepanida has put it. Have some more, little sir, have some more. . . ."</quote>

The old woman gave a yawn and, putting her right hand behind her, scratched her left shoulder.

<quote connection="s23520" id="s23442" oid="491" speaker="the_old_woman">"It must be two o'clock now,"</quote> <mention connection="s23442,s23443" id="s23520" speaker="the_old_woman">she</mention> said; <quote connection="s23520" id="s23443" oid="492" speaker="the_old_woman">"it will soon be time to get up.

<quote connection="s23523" id="s23444" oid="493" speaker="Yegorushka">"Granny,"</quote> said <mention connection="s23444,s23445" id="s23523" speaker="Yegorushka">Yegorushka</mention>. <quote connection="s23523" id="s23445" oid="494" speaker="Yegorushka">"I am sleepy."</quote>

I was asleep, when I heard a noise as though <mention>someone</mention> were knocking. I woke up and looked, and it was the storm God had sent us. . . . I'd have lighted the candle, but I couldn't find it."</quote>

Talking to herself, she pulled some rags, probably her own bed, off the bench, took two sheepskins off a nail by the stove, and began laying them out for a bed for <mention>Yegorushka</mention>. <quote connection="s23525" id="s23448" oid="497" speaker="the_old_woman">"The storm doesn't grow less,"</quote> <mention connection="s23448,s23449" id="s23525" speaker="the_old_woman">she</mention> muttered. <quote connection="s23525" id="s23449" oid="498" speaker="the_old_woman">"If only nothing's struck in an unlucky hour. Our lads are out on the steppe for the night. Lie down and sleep, my dear. . . . Christ be with you, my child. . . . I won't take away the melon; maybe you'll have a bit when you get up."</quote>

The sighs and yawns of <mention>the old woman</mention>, the even breathing of the sleeping woman, the half-darkness of the hut, and <mention>the sound</mention> of the rain outside, made one sleepy. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> was shy of undressing before <mention>the old woman</mention>. He only took off his boots, lay down and covered himself with the sheepskin.

<quote connection="s23526" id="s23450" oid="499" speaker="Yegorushka">"Is the little lad lying down?"</quote> <mention connection="s23450" id="s23526" speaker="Yegorushka">he</mention> heard Panteley whisper a little later.

<quote connection="s23527" id="s23451" oid="500" speaker="the_old_woman">"Yes,"</quote> answered <mention connection="s23451,s23452" id="s23527" speaker="the_old_woman">the old woman</mention> in a whisper. <quote connection="s23527" id="s23452" oid="501" speaker="the_old_woman">"The terror of the Lord!

<quote connection="s23528" id="s23453" oid="502" speaker="Panteley">"It will soon be over,"</quote> wheezed <mention connection="s23453,s23454" id="s23528" speaker="Panteley">Panteley</mention>, sitting down; <quote connection="s23528" id="s23454" oid="503" speaker="Panteley">"it's getting quieter. . . .

I'll sit here a bit and then go and take my turn. . . . We can't leave them; they would be taken. . . ."</quote>

Panteley and <mention>the old woman</mention> sat side by side at Yegorushka's feet, talking in hissing whispers and interspersing their speech with sighs and yawns. And <mention>Yegorushka</mention> could not get warm. The warm heavy sheepskin lay on him, but he was trembling all over; his arms and legs were twitching, and his whole inside was shivering. . . . He undressed under the sheepskin, but that was no good. His shivering grew more and more acute.

<mention>Panteley</mention> went out to take his turn with the horses, and afterwards came back again, and still <mention>Yegorushka</mention> was shivering all over and could not get to sleep. Something weighed upon his head and chest and oppressed him, and he did not know what it was, whether it was the old people whispering, or the heavy smell of the sheepskin. The melon he had eaten had left an unpleasant metallic taste in his mouth. Moreover he was being bitten by fleas.

<quote connection="s23508" id="s23455" oid="504" speaker="Yegorushka">"Grandfather, I am cold,"</quote> <mention connection="s23455" id="s23508" speaker="Yegorushka">he</mention> said, and did not know his own voice.

<quote connection="s23529" id="s23456" oid="505" speaker="the_old_woman">"Go to sleep, my child, go to sleep,"</quote> sighed <mention connection="s23456" id="s23529" speaker="the_old_woman">the old woman</mention>.

<mention>Tit</mention> came up to the bedside on his thin little legs and waved his arms, then grew up to the ceiling and turned into a windmill. . . . <mention>Father Christopher</mention>, not as he was in the chaise, but in his full vestments with the sprinkler in his hand, walked round the mill, sprinkling it with holy water, and it left off waving. Yegorushka, knowing this was delirium, opened his eyes.

<quote connection="s23509" id="s23457" oid="506" speaker="Yegorushka">"Grandfather,"</quote> <mention connection="s23457,s23458" id="s23509" speaker="Yegorushka">he</mention> called, <quote connection="s23509" id="s23458" oid="507" speaker="Yegorushka">"give me some water."</quote>

No one answered. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> felt it insufferably stifling and uncomfortable lying down. He got up, dressed, and went out of the hut. Morning was beginning. The sky was overcast, but it was no longer raining. Shivering and wrapping himself in his wet overcoat, <mention>Yegorushka</mention> walked about the muddy yard and listened to the silence; he caught sight of a little shed with a half-open door made of reeds. He looked into this shed, went into it, and sat down in a dark corner on a heap of dry dung.

There was a tangle of thoughts in his heavy head; his mouth was dry and unpleasant from the metallic taste. He looked at his hat, straightened the peacock's feather on it, and thought how he had gone with his mother to buy the hat. He put his hand into his pocket and took out a lump of brownish sticky paste. How had that paste come into his pocket? He thought a minute, smelt it; it smelt of honey. Aha! it was the Jewish cake! How sopped it was, poor thing!

<mention>Yegorushka</mention> examined his coat. It was a little grey overcoat with big bone buttons, cut in the shape of a frock-coat. At home, being a new and expensive article, it had not been hung in the hall, but with his mother's dresses in her bedroom; he was only allowed to wear it on holidays. Looking at it, <mention>Yegorushka</mention> felt sorry for it. He thought that he and the great-coat were both abandoned to the mercy of destiny; he thought that he would never get back home, and began sobbing so violently that he almost fell off the heap of dung.

A big white dog with woolly tufts like curl-papers about its face, sopping from the rain, came into the shed and stared with curiosity at <mention>Yegorushka</mention>. It seemed to be hesitating whether to bark or not. Deciding that there was no need to bark, it went cautiously up to <mention>Yegorushka</mention>, ate the sticky plaster and went out again.

<quote connection="s23510" id="s23459" oid="508" speaker="someone">"There are Varlamov's men!"</quote> <mention connection="s23459" id="s23510" speaker="someone">someone</mention> shouted in the street.

After having his cry out, <mention>Yegorushka</mention> went out of the shed and, walking round a big puddle, made his way towards the street. The waggons were standing exactly opposite the gateway. The drenched waggoners, with their muddy feet, were sauntering beside them or sitting on the shafts, as listless and drowsy as flies in autumn. <mention connection="s23460" id="s23511" speaker="Yegorushka">Yegorushka</mention> looked at them and thought: <quote connection="s23511" id="s23460" oid="509" speaker="Yegorushka">"How dreary and comfortless to be a peasant!"</quote> He went up to <mention>Panteley</mention> and sat down beside him on the shaft.

<quote connection="s23512" id="s23461" oid="510" speaker="Yegorushka">"Grandfather, I'm cold,"</quote> <mention connection="s23461" id="s23512" speaker="Yegorushka">he</mention> said, shivering and thrusting his hands up his sleeves.

<quote connection="s23513" id="s23462" oid="511" speaker="Panteley">"Never mind, we shall soon be there,"</quote> yawned <mention connection="s23462,s23463" id="s23513" speaker="Panteley">Panteley</mention>. <quote connection="s23513" id="s23463" oid="512" speaker="Panteley">"Never mind, you will get warm."</quote>

It must have been early when the waggons set off, for it was not hot. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> lay on the bales of wool and shivered with cold, though the sun soon came out and dried his clothes, the bales, and the earth. As soon as he closed his eyes he saw <mention>Tit</mention> and the windmill again. Feeling a sickness and heaviness all over, he did his utmost to drive away these images, but as soon as they vanished the dare-devil Dymov, with red eyes and lifted fists, rushed at <mention>Yegorushka</mention> with a roar, or there was <mention>the sound</mention> of <mention connection="s23464" id="s23514" speaker="Yegorushka">his complaint</mention>: <quote connection="s23514" id="s23464" oid="513" speaker="Yegorushka">"I am so dreary!"</quote> Varlamov rode by on his little Cossack stallion; happy Konstantin passed, with a smile and the bustard in his arms. And how tedious these people were, how sickening and unbearable!

Once-- it was towards evening-- he raised his head to ask for water. The waggons were standing on a big bridge across a broad river. There was black smoke below over the river, and through it could be seen a steamer with a barge in tow. Ahead of them, beyond the river, was a huge mountain dotted with houses and churches; at the foot of the mountain an engine was being shunted along beside some goods trucks.

<mention>Yegorushka</mention> had never before seen steamers, nor engines, nor broad rivers. Glancing at them now, he was not alarmed or surprised; there was not even a look of anything like curiosity in his face. He merely felt sick, and made haste to turn over to the edge of the bale. He was sick. <mention>Panteley</mention>, seeing this, cleared his throat and shook his head.

<quote connection="s23515" id="s23465" oid="514" speaker="Panteley">"Our little lad's taken ill,"</quote> <mention connection="s23465,s23466" id="s23515" speaker="Panteley">he</mention> said. <quote connection="s23515" id="s23466" oid="515" speaker="Panteley">"He must have got a chill to the stomach. The little lad must. . . away from home; it's a bad lookout!"</quote></chapter><chapter>VIII

The waggons stopped at a big inn for merchants, not far from the quay. As <mention>Yegorushka</mention> climbed down from the waggon he heard a very familiar voice. <mention connection="s26729" id="s26843" speaker="Deniska">Someone</mention> was helping him to get down, and saying:

<quote connection="s26843" id="s26729" oid="516" speaker="Deniska">"We arrived yesterday evening. . . . We have been expecting you all day. We meant to overtake you yesterday, but it was out of our way; we came by the other road. I say, how you have crumpled your coat! You'll catch it from your uncle!"</quote>

Yegorushka looked into the speaker's mottled face and remembered that this was <mention connection="s26730" id="s26844" speaker="Deniska">Deniska</mention>.

<quote connection="s26844" id="s26730" oid="517" speaker="Deniska">"Your uncle and <mention>Father Christopher</mention> are in the inn now, drinking tea; come along!"</quote>

And he led <mention>Yegorushka</mention> to a big two-storied building, dark and gloomy like the almshouse at N. After going across the entry, up a dark staircase and through a narrow corridor, <mention>Yegorushka</mention> and <mention>Deniska</mention> reached a little room in which <mention>Ivan Ivanitch</mention> and <mention>Father Christopher</mention> were sitting at the tea-table. Seeing the boy, both the old men showed surprise and pleasure.

<quote connection="s26845" id="s26731" oid="518" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"Aha! Yegor Ni-ko-la-aitch!"</quote> chanted <mention connection="s26731,s26732" id="s26845" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">Father Christopher</mention>. <quote connection="s26845" id="s26732" oid="519" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"Mr. Lomonosov!"</quote>

<quote connection="s26846" id="s26733" oid="520" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"Ah, our gentleman that is to be,"</quote> said<mention connection="s26733,s26734" id="s26846" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov"> Kuzmitchov</mention>, <quote connection="s26846" id="s26734" oid="521" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"pleased to see you!"</quote>

Yegorushka took off his great-coat, kissed his uncle's hand and <mention>Father Christopher</mention>'s, and sat down to the table.

<quote connection="s26847" id="s26735" oid="522" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"Well, how did you like the journey, puer bone?"</quote> <mention connection="s26735,s26736" id="s26847" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">Father Christopher </mention>pelted him with questions as he poured him out some tea, with his radiant smile. <quote connection="s26847" id="s26736" oid="523" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"Sick of it, I've no doubt? God save us all from having to travel by waggon or with oxen. You go on and on, God forgive us; you look ahead and the steppe is always lying stretched out the same as it was-- you can't see the end of it! It's not travelling but regular torture. Why don't you drink your tea? Drink it up; and in your absence, while you have been trailing along with the waggons, we have settled all our business capitally. Thank God we have sold our wool to Tcherepahin, and no one could wish to have done better. . . . We have made a good bargain."</quote>

At the first sight of his own people <mention>Yegorushka</mention> felt an overwhelming desire to complain. He did not listen to <mention>Father Christopher</mention>, but thought how to begin and what exactly to complain of. But Father Christopher's voice, which seemed to him harsh and unpleasant, prevented him from concentrating his attention and confused his thoughts. He had not sat at the table five minutes before he got up, went to the sofa and lay down.

<quote connection="s26848" id="s26737" oid="524" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"Well, well,"</quote> said <mention connection="s26737,s26738" id="s26848" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">Father Christopher</mention> in surprise. <quote connection="s26848" id="s26738" oid="525" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"What about your tea?"</quote>

Still thinking what to complain of, <mention>Yegorushka</mention> leaned his head against the wall and broke into sobs.

<quote connection="s26849" id="s26739" oid="526" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"Well, well!"</quote> repeated <mention connection="s26739,s26740" id="s26849" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">Father Christopher</mention>, getting up and going to the sofa. <quote connection="s26849" id="s26740" oid="527" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"Yegory, what is the matter with you? Why are you crying?"</quote>

<quote connection="s26850" id="s26741" oid="528" speaker="Yegorushka">"I'm . . . I'm ill,"</quote> <mention connection="s26741" id="s26850" speaker="Yegorushka">Yegorushka</mention> brought out.

<quote connection="s26851" id="s26742" oid="529" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"Ill?"</quote> said <mention connection="s26742,s26743" id="s26851" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">Father Christopher</mention> in amazement. <quote connection="s26851" id="s26743" oid="530" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"That's not the right thing, my boy. . . . One mustn't be ill on a journey. Aie, aie, what are you thinking about, boy . . . eh?"</quote>

<mention connection="s26744,s26746,s26748" id="s26852" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">He</mention> put his hand to Yegorushka's head, touched his cheek and said:

<quote connection="s26852" id="s26744" oid="531" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"Yes, your head's feverish. . . . You must have caught cold or else have eaten something. . . . Pray to God."</quote>

<quote connection="s26853" id="s26745" oid="532" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"Should we give him quinine? . . ."</quote> said <mention connection="s26745" id="s26853" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Ivan Ivanitch</mention>, troubled.

<quote connection="s26852" id="s26746" oid="533" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"No; he ought to have something hot. . . . Yegory, have a little drop of soup? Eh?"</quote>

<quote connection="s26854" id="s26747" oid="534" speaker="Yegorushka">"I. . . don't want any,"</quote> said <mention connection="s26747,s26749" id="s26854" speaker="Yegorushka">Yegorushka</mention>.

<quote connection="s26852" id="s26748" oid="535" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"Are you feeling chilly?"</quote>

<quote connection="s26854" id="s26749" oid="536" speaker="Yegorushka">"I was chilly before, but now . . . now I am hot. And I ache all over. . . ."</quote>

Ivan Ivanitch went up to the sofa, touched <mention>Yegorushka</mention> on the head, cleared his throat with a perplexed air, and went back to the table.

<quote connection="s26855" id="s26750" oid="537" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"I tell you what, you undress and go to bed,"</quote> said <mention connection="s26750,s26751" id="s26855" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">Father Christopher</mention>. <quote connection="s26855" id="s26751" oid="538" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"What you want is sleep now."</quote>

He helped <mention>Yegorushka</mention> to undress, gave him a pillow and covered him with a quilt, and over that Ivan Ivanitch's great-coat. Then he walked away on tiptoe and sat down to the table. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> shut his eyes, and at once it seemed to him that he was not in the hotel room, but on the highroad beside the camp fire. <mention>Emelyan</mention> waved his hands, and <mention>Dymov</mention> with red eyes lay on his stomach and looked mockingly at <mention>Yegorushka</mention>.

<quote connection="s26856" id="s26752" oid="539" speaker="Yegorushka">"Beat him, beat him!"</quote> shouted <mention connection="s26752" id="s26856" speaker="Yegorushka">Yegorushka</mention>.

<quote connection="s26857" id="s26753" oid="540" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"He is delirious,"</quote> said <mention connection="s26753,s26755" id="s26857" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">Father Christopher</mention> in an undertone.

<quote connection="s26858" id="s26754" oid="541" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"It's a nuisance!"</quote> sighed <mention connection="s26754" id="s26858" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Ivan Ivanitch</mention>.

<quote connection="s26857" id="s26755" oid="542" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"He must be rubbed with oil and vinegar. Please God, he will be better to-morrow."</quote>

To be rid of bad dreams, <mention>Yegorushka</mention> opened his eyes and began looking towards the fire. <mention>Father Christopher</mention> and <mention>Ivan Ivanitch</mention> had now finished their tea and were talking in a whisper. The first was smiling with delight, and evidently could not forget that he had made a good bargain over his wool; what delighted him was not so much the actual profit he had made as the thought that on getting home he would gather round him his big family, wink slyly and go off into a chuckle; at first he would deceive them all, and say that he had sold the wool at a price below its value, then <mention connection="s26756" id="s26859" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">he</mention> would give his son-in-law, Mihail, a fat pocket-book and say: <quote connection="s26859" id="s26756" oid="543" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"Well, take it! that's the way to do business!"</quote> Kuzmitchov did not seem pleased; his face expressed, as before, a business-like reserve and anxiety.
<quote connection="s26860" id="s26862" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">
"If I could have known that Tcherepahin would give such a price,"</quote> <mention connection="s26862,s26758" id="s26860" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">he</mention> said in a low voice, <quote connection="s26860" id="s26758" oid="545" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"I wouldn't have sold Makarov those five tons at home. It is vexatious! But who could have told that the price had gone up here?"</quote>

A man in a white shirt cleared away the samovar and lighted the little lamp before the ikon in the corner. <mention>Father Christopher</mention> whispered something in his ear; <mention connection="s26759" id="s26863" speaker="the_man">the man</mention> looked, made a serious face like a conspirator, as though to say, <quote connection="s26863" id="s26759" oid="546" speaker="the_man">"I understand,"</quote> went out, and returned a little while afterwards and put something under the sofa. <mention>Ivan Ivanitch</mention> made himself a bed on the floor, yawned several times, said his prayers lazily, and lay down.

<quote connection="s26864" id="s26760" oid="547" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"I think of going to the cathedral to-morrow,"</quote> said <mention connection="s26760,s26761" id="s26864" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">Father Christopher</mention>. <quote connection="s26864" id="s26761" oid="548" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"I know the sacristan there. I ought to go and see the bishop after mass, but they say he is ill."</quote>

He yawned and put out the lamp. Now there was no light in the room but the little lamp before the ikon.

<quote connection="s26865" id="s26762" oid="549" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"They say he can't receive visitors,"</quote> <mention connection="s26762,s26763" id="s26865" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">Father Christopher</mention> went on, undressing. <quote connection="s26865" id="s26763" oid="550" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"So I shall go away without seeing him."</quote>

He took off his full coat, and <mention>Yegorushka</mention> saw Robinson Crusoe reappear. <mention connection="s26764" id="s26866" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">Robinson</mention> stirred something in a saucer, went up to <mention>Yegorushka</mention> and whispered:

<quote connection="s26866" id="s26764" oid="551" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"Lomonosov, are you asleep? Sit up; I'm going to rub you with oil and vinegar. It's a good thing, only you must say a prayer."</quote>

<mention connection="s26767" id="s26868" speaker="Yegorushka">Yegorushka</mention> roused himself quickly and sat up. <mention>Father Christopher</mention> pulled down the boy's shirt, and shrinking and breathing jerkily, as though he were being tickled himself, began rubbing Yegorushka's chest.

<quote connection="s26867" id="s26765" oid="552" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost,"</quote> <mention connection="s26765,s26766,s26768" id="s26867" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">he</mention> whispered, <quote connection="s26867" id="s26766" oid="553" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"lie with your back upwards-- that's it. . . . You'll be all right to-morrow, but don't do it again. . . . You are as hot as fire. I suppose you were on the road in the storm."</quote>

<quote connection="s26868" id="s26767" oid="554" speaker="Yegorushka">"Yes."</quote>

<quote connection="s26867" id="s26768" oid="555" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"You might well fall ill! In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, . . . you might well fall ill!"</quote>

After rubbing <mention>Yegorushka</mention>, <mention>Father Christopher</mention> put on his shirt again, covered him, made the sign of the cross over him, and walked away. Then <mention>Yegorushka</mention> saw him saying his prayers. Probably the old man knew a great many prayers by heart, for he stood a long time before the ikon murmuring. After saying his prayers he made the sign of the cross over the window, the door, <mention>Yegorushka</mention>, and <mention>Ivan Ivanitch</mention>, lay down on the little sofa without a pillow, and covered himself with his full coat. A clock in the corridor struck ten. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> thought how long a time it would be before morning; feeling miserable, he pressed his forehead against the back of the sofa and left off trying to get rid of the oppressive misty dreams. But morning came much sooner than he expected.

It seemed to him that he had not been lying long with his head pressed to the back of the sofa, but when he opened his eyes slanting rays of sunlight were already shining on the floor through the two windows of the little hotel room. <mention>Father Christopher</mention> and <mention>Ivan Ivanitch</mention> were not in the room. The room had been tidied; it was bright, snug, and smelt of <mention>Father Christopher</mention>, who always smelt of cypress and dried cornflowers (at home he used to make the holy-water sprinklers and decorations for the ikonstands out of cornflowers, and so he was saturated with the smell of them). <mention>Yegorushka</mention> looked at the pillow, at the slanting sunbeams, at his boots, which had been cleaned and were standing side by side near the sofa, and laughed. It seemed strange to him that he was not on the bales of wool, that everything was dry around him, and that there was no thunder and lightning on the ceiling.

He jumped off the sofa and began dressing. He felt splendid; nothing was left of his yesterday's illness but a slight weakness in his legs and neck. So the vinegar and oil had done good. He remembered the steamer, the railway engine, and the broad river, which he had dimly seen the day before, and now he made haste to dress, to run to the quay and have a look at them. When he had washed and was putting on his red shirt, the latch of the door clicked, and <mention>Father Christopher</mention> appeared in the doorway, wearing his top-hat and a brown silk cassock over his canvas coat and carrying his staff in his hand. Smiling and radiant (old men are always radiant when they come back from church), <mention connection="s26769,s26771" id="s26869" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">he</mention> put a roll of holy bread and a parcel of some sort on the table, prayed before the ikon, and said:

<quote connection="s26869" id="s26769" oid="556" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"God has sent us blessings-- well, how are you?"</quote>

<quote connection="s26870" id="s26770" oid="557" speaker="Yegorushka">"Quite well now,"</quote> answered <mention connection="s26770" id="s26870" speaker="Yegorushka">Yegorushka</mention>, kissing his hand.

<quote connection="s26869" id="s26771" oid="558" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"Thank God. . . . I have come from mass. I've been to see a sacristan I know. He invited me to breakfast with him, but I didn't go. I don't like visiting people too early, God bless them!"</quote>

He took off his cassock, stroked himself on the chest, and without haste undid the parcel. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> saw a little tin of caviare, a piece of dry sturgeon, and a French loaf.

<quote connection="s26871" id="s26772" oid="559" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"See; I passed a fish-shop and brought this,"</quote> said <mention connection="s26772,s26773" id="s26871" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">Father Christopher</mention>. <quote connection="s26871" id="s26773" oid="560" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"There is no need to indulge in luxuries on an ordinary weekday; but I thought, I've an invalid at home, so it is excusable. And the caviare is good, real sturgeon. . . ."</quote>

The man in the white shirt brought in the samovar and a tray with tea-things.

<quote connection="s26872" id="s26774" oid="561" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"Eat some,"</quote> said <mention connection="s26774,s26775" id="s26872" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">Father Christopher</mention>, spreading the caviare on a slice of bread and handing it to <mention>Yegorushka</mention>. <quote connection="s26872" id="s26775" oid="562" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"Eat now and enjoy yourself, but the time will soon come for you to be studying. Mind you study with attention and application, so that good may come of it. What you have to learn by heart, learn by heart, but when you have to tell the inner sense in your own words, without regard to the outer form, then say it in your own words. And try to master all subjects. One man knows mathematics excellently, but has never heard of Pyotr Mogila; another knows about Pyotr Mogila, but cannot explain about the moon. But you study so as to understand everything. Study Latin, French, German, . . . geography, of course, history, theology, philosophy, mathematics, . . . and when you have mastered everything, not with haste but with prayer and with zeal, then go into the service. When you know everything it will be easy for you in any line of life. . . . You study and strive for the divine blessing, and God will show you what to be. Whether a doctor, a judge or an engineer. . . ."</quote>

<mention connection="s26776" id="s26873" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">Father Christopher</mention> spread a little caviare on a piece of bread, put it in his mouth and said:

Basil the Great studied mathematics and philosophy-- so you study them; St. Nestor wrote history-- so you study and write history. Take example from the saints."</quote>

Father Christopher sipped the tea from his saucer, wiped his moustaches, and shook his head.

Or when the circuit court comes and one has to take the oath, all the other priests are shy, but I am quite at home with the judges, the prosecutors, and the lawyers. I talk intellectually, drink a cup of tea with them, laugh, ask them what I don't know, . . . and they like it. So that's how it is, my boy. Learning is light and ignorance is darkness. Study!

<quote connection="s26877" id="s26781" oid="567" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"Only mind, Yegory, don't forget your mother and <mention>Ivan Ivanitch</mention>, God preserve you from it.

<mention connection="s26782" id="s26878" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">Father Christopher</mention> raised his hand and repeated in a thin voice:

<quote connection="s26878" id="s26782" oid="568" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"Woe to you! Woe to you!"</quote>

Father Christopher's tongue was loosened, and he was, as they say, warming to his subject; he would not have finished till dinnertime but the door opened and <mention>Ivan Ivanitch</mention> walked in. He said good-morning hurriedly, sat down to the table, and began rapidly swallowing his tea.

<quote connection="s26879" id="s26783" oid="569" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"Well, I have settled all our business,"</quote> <mention connection="s26783,s26784" id="s26879" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">he</mention> said. <quote connection="s26879" id="s26784" oid="570" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"We might have gone home to-day, but we have still to think about Yegor.

<mention connection="s26785,s26786" id="s26880" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">He</mention> rummaged in his pocket-book, found a crumpled note and read:

<quote connection="s26880" id="s26785" oid="571" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"<quote connection="s26880" id="s26786" oid="" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">'Little Lower Street: Nastasya Petrovna Toskunov, living in a house of her own.'</quote> We must go at once and try to find her. It's a nuisance!"</quote>

Soon after breakfast Ivan Ivanitch and <mention>Yegorushka</mention> left the inn.

<quote connection="s26881" id="s26787" oid="572" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"It's a nuisance,"</quote> muttered <mention connection="s26787,s26788" id="s26881" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">his uncle</mention>. <quote connection="s26881" id="s26788" oid="573" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"You are sticking to me like a burr. You and your mother want education and gentlemanly breeding and I have nothing but worry with you both. . . ."</quote>

When they crossed the yard, the waggons and the drivers were not there. They had all gone off to the quay early in the morning. In a far-off dark corner of the yard stood the chaise.

<quote connection="s26882" id="s26789" oid="574" speaker="Yegorushka">"Good-bye, chaise!"</quote> thought <mention connection="s26789" id="s26882" speaker="Yegorushka">Yegorushka</mention>.

At first they had to go a long way uphill by a broad street, then they had to cross a big marketplace; here <mention>Ivan Ivanitch</mention> asked a policeman for Little Lower Street.

<quote connection="s26914" id="s26790" oid="575" speaker="policeman">"I say,"</quote> said <mention connection="s26790,s26791" id="s26914" speaker="policeman">the policeman</mention>, with a grin, <quote connection="s26914" id="s26791" oid="576" speaker="policeman">"it's a long way off, out that way towards the town grazing ground."</quote>

They met several cabs but <mention>Ivan Ivanitch</mention> only permitted himself such a weakness as taking a cab in exceptional cases and on great holidays. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> and he walked for a long while through paved streets, then along streets where there were only wooden planks at the sides and no pavements, and in the end got to streets where there were neither planks nor pavements. When their legs and their tongues had brought them to Little Lower Street they were both red in the face, and taking off their hats, wiped away the perspiration.

<quote connection="s26883" id="s26792" oid="577" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"Tell me, please,"</quote> said <mention connection="s26792,s26793,s26796" id="s26883" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Ivan Ivanitch</mention>, addressing <mention>an old man</mention> sitting on a little bench by a gate, <quote connection="s26883" id="s26793" oid="578" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"where is Nastasya Petrovna Toskunov's house?"</quote>

<quote connection="s26884" id="s26794" oid="579" speaker="an_old_man">"There is no one called Toskunov here,"</quote> said <mention connection="s26794,s26795,s26797" id="s26884" speaker="an_old_man">the old man</mention>, after pondering a moment. <quote connection="s26884" id="s26795" oid="580" speaker="an_old_man">"Perhaps it's Timoshenko you want."</quote>

<quote connection="s26883" id="s26796" oid="581" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"No, Toskunov. . . ."</quote>

<quote connection="s26884" id="s26797" oid="582" speaker="an_old_man">"Excuse me, there's no one called Toskunov. . . ."</quote>

Ivan Ivanitch shrugged his shoulders and trudged on farther.

<quote connection="s26885" id="s26798" oid="583" speaker="an_old_man">"You needn't look,"</quote> <mention connection="s26798,s26799" id="s26885" speaker="an_old_man">the old man</mention> called after them. <quote connection="s26885" id="s26799" oid="584" speaker="an_old_man">"I tell you there isn't, and there isn't."</quote>

<quote connection="s26886" id="s26800" oid="585" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"Listen, auntie,"</quote> said <mention connection="s26800,s26801" id="s26886" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Ivan Ivanitch</mention>, addressing <mention>an old woman</mention> who was sitting at a corner with a tray of pears and sunflower seeds, <quote connection="s26886" id="s26801" oid="586" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"where is Nastasya Petrovna Toskunov's house?"</quote>

The old woman looked at him with surprise and laughed.

<quote connection="s26887" id="s26802" oid="587" speaker="an_old_woman">"Why, <mention>Nastasya Petrovna</mention> live in her own house now!"</quote> <mention connection="s26802,s26803" id="s26887" speaker="an_old_woman">she</mention> cried. <quote connection="s26887" id="s26803" oid="588" speaker="an_old_woman">"Lord! it is eight years since she married her daughter and gave up the house to her son-in-law! It's her son-in-law lives there now."</quote>

And <mention connection="s26804" id="s26888" speaker="an_old_woman">her eyes</mention> expressed: <quote connection="s26888" id="s26804" oid="589" speaker="an_old_woman">"How is it you didn't know a simple thing like that, you fools?"</quote>

<quote connection="s26889" id="s26805" oid="590" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"And where does she live now?"</quote> <mention connection="s26805" id="s26889" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Ivan Ivanitch</mention> asked.

<quote connection="s26890" id="s26806" oid="591" speaker="an_old_woman">"Oh, Lord!"</quote> cried <mention connection="s26806,s26807" id="s26890" speaker="an_old_woman">the old woman</mention>, flinging up her hands in surprise. <quote connection="s26890" id="s26807" oid="592" speaker="an_old_woman">"She moved ever so long ago! It's eight years since she gave up her house to her son-in-law! Upon my word!"</quote>

She probably expected <mention connection="s26808" id="s26891" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Ivan Ivanitch</mention> to be surprised, too, and to exclaim: <quote connection="s26891" id="s26808" oid="593" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"You don't say so,"</quote> but <mention connection="s26809" id="s26892" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Ivan Ivanitch</mention> asked very calmly:

<quote connection="s26892" id="s26809" oid="594" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"Where does she live now?"</quote>

<mention connection="s26810" id="s26893" speaker="an_old_woman">The old woman</mention> tucked up her sleeves and, stretching out her bare arm to point, shouted in a shrill piercing voice:

<quote connection="s26893" id="s26810" oid="595" speaker="an_old_woman">"Go straight on, straight on, straight on. You will pass a little red house, then you will see a little alley on your left. Turn down that little alley, and it will be the third gate on the right. . . ."</quote>

Ivan Ivanitch and <mention>Yegorushka</mention> reached the little red house, turned to the left down the little alley, and made for the third gate on the right. On both sides of this very old grey gate there was a grey fence with big gaps in it. The first part of the fence was tilting forwards and threatened to fall, while on the left of the gate it sloped backwards towards the yard. The gate itself stood upright and seemed to be still undecided which would suit it best --to fall forwards or backwards. <mention>Ivan Ivanitch</mention> opened the little gate at the side, and he and <mention>Yegorushka</mention> saw a big yard overgrown with weeds and burdocks. A hundred paces from the gate stood a little house with a red roof and green shutters. <mention connection="s26811" id="s26894" speaker="Nastasya_Petrovna">A stout woman</mention> with her sleeves tucked up and her apron held out was standing in the middle of the yard, scattering something on the ground and shouting in <mention>a voice</mention> as shrill as that of the woman selling fruit:

<quote connection="s26894" id="s26811" oid="596" speaker="Nastasya_Petrovna">"Chick! . . . Chick! . . . Chick!"</quote>

Behind her sat a red dog with pointed ears. Seeing the strangers, he ran to the little gate and broke into a tenor bark (all red dogs have a tenor bark).

<quote connection="s26895" id="s26812" oid="597" speaker="Nastasya_Petrovna">"Whom do you want?"</quote> asked <mention connection="s26812,s26815" id="s26895" speaker="Nastasya_Petrovna">the woman</mention>, putting up her hand to shade her eyes from the sun.

<quote connection="s26896" id="s26813" oid="598" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"Good-morning!"</quote> <mention connection="s26813,s26814,s26816,s26818" id="s26896" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Ivan Ivanitch</mention> shouted, too, waving off the red dog with his stick. <quote connection="s26896" id="s26814" oid="599" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"Tell me, please, does Nastasya Petrovna Toskunov live here?"</quote>

<quote connection="s26895" id="s26815" oid="600" speaker="Nastasya_Petrovna">"Yes! But what do you want with her?"</quote>

<quote connection="s26896" id="s26816" oid="601" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"Perhaps you are <mention connection="s26817" id="s26897" speaker="Nastasya_Petrovna">Nastasya Petrovna</mention>?"</quote>

<quote connection="s26897" id="s26817" oid="602" speaker="Nastasya_Petrovna">"Well, yes, I am!"</quote>

<quote connection="s26896" id="s26818" oid="603" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"Very pleased to see you. . . . You see, your old friend Olga Ivanovna Knyasev sends her love to you. This is her little son. And I, perhaps you remember, am her brother <mention>Ivan Ivanitch</mention>. . . . You are one of us from N.. . . You were born among us and married there. . . ."</quote>

A silence followed. The stout woman stared blankly at <mention>Ivan Ivanitch</mention>, as though not believing or not understanding him, then she flushed all over, and flung up her hands; the oats were scattered out of her apron and tears spurted from her eyes.

<quote connection="s26898" id="s26819" oid="604" speaker="Nastasya_Petrovna">"Olga Ivanovna!"</quote> <mention connection="s26819,s26820" id="s26898" speaker="Nastasya_Petrovna">she</mention> screamed, breathless with excitement. <quote connection="s26898" id="s26820" oid="605" speaker="Nastasya_Petrovna">"My own darling! Ah, holy saints, why am I standing here like a fool? My pretty little angel. . . ."</quote>

She embraced <mention>Yegorushka</mention>, wetted his face with her tears, and broke down completely.

<quote connection="s26899" id="s26821" oid="606" speaker="Nastasya_Petrovna">"Heavens!"</quote> <mention connection="s26821,s26822" id="s26899" speaker="Nastasya_Petrovna">she</mention> said, wringing her hands, <quote connection="s26899" id="s26822" oid="607" speaker="Nastasya_Petrovna">"Olga's little boy! How delightful! He is his mother all over! The image of his mother! But why are you standing in the yard? Come indoors."</quote>

Crying, gasping for breath and talking as she went, she hurried towards the house. Her visitors trudged after her.

<quote connection="s26900" id="s26823" oid="608" speaker="Nastasya_Petrovna">"The room has not been done yet,"</quote> <mention connection="s26823,s26824" id="s26900" speaker="Nastasya_Petrovna">she</mention> said, ushering the visitors into a stuffy little drawing-room adorned with many ikons and pots of flowers. <quote connection="s26900" id="s26824" oid="609" speaker="Nastasya_Petrovna">"Oh, Mother of God! Vassilisa, go and open the shutters anyway! My little angel! My little beauty! I did not know that Olitchka had a boy like that!"</quote>

When she had calmed down and got over her first surprise <mention>Ivan Ivanitch</mention> asked to speak to her alone. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> went into another room; there was a sewing-machine; in the window was a cage with a starling in it, and there were as many ikons and flowers as in the drawing-room. Near the machine stood a little girl with a sunburnt face and chubby cheeks like <mention>Tit</mention>'s, and a clean cotton dress. She stared at <mention>Yegorushka</mention> without blinking, and apparently felt very awkward. <mention connection="s26825" id="s26901" speaker="Yegorushka">Yegorushka</mention> looked at her and after a pause asked:

<quote connection="s26901" id="s26825" oid="610" speaker="Yegorushka">"What's your name?"</quote>

<mention connection="s26826" id="s26903" speaker="Katka">The little girl</mention> moved her lips, looked as if she were going to cry, and answered softly:

<quote connection="s26903" id="s26826" oid="611" speaker="Katka">"Atka. . . ."</quote>

This meant <mention>Katka</mention>.

<quote connection="s26904" id="s26827" oid="612" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"He will live with you,"</quote> <mention connection="s26827,s26828" id="s26904" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Ivan Ivanitch</mention> was whispering in the drawing-room, <quote connection="s26904" id="s26828" oid="613" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"if you will be so kind, and we will pay ten roubles a month for his keep. He is not a spoilt boy; he is quiet. . . ."</quote>

<quote connection="s26907" id="s26829" oid="614" speaker="Nastasya_Petrovna">"I really don't know what to say, Ivan Ivanitch!"</quote> <mention connection="s26829,s26830" id="s26907" speaker="Nastasya_Petrovna">Nastasya Petrovna</mention> sighed tearfully. <quote connection="s26907" id="s26830" oid="615" speaker="Nastasya_Petrovna">"Ten roubles a month is very good, but it is a dreadful thing to take another person's child! He may fall ill or something. . . ."</quote>

When <mention>Yegorushka</mention> was summoned back to the drawing-room <mention>Ivan Ivanitch</mention> was standing with his hat in his hands, saying good-bye.

<quote connection="s26905" id="s26831" oid="616" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"Well, let him stay with you now, then,"</quote> <mention connection="s26831" id="s26905" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">he</mention> said. <quote connection="s26906" id="s26832" oid="617" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"Good-bye! You stay, Yegor!"</quote> <mention connection="s26832,s26833" id="s26906" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">he</mention> said, addressing his nephew. <quote connection="s26906" id="s26833" oid="618" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"Don't be troublesome; mind you obey <mention>Nastasya Petrovna</mention>. . . . Good-bye; I am coming again to-morrow."</quote>

And he went away. Nastasya once more embraced Yegorushka, called him a little angel, and with a tear-stained face began preparing for dinner. Three minutes later <mention>Yegorushka</mention> was sitting beside her, answering her endless questions and eating hot savoury cabbage soup.

In the evening he sat again at the same table and, resting his head on his hand, listened to <mention>Nastasya Petrovna</mention>. Alternately laughing and crying, she talked of his mother's young days, her own marriage, her children. . . . A cricket chirruped in the stove, and there was a faint humming from the burner of the lamp. <mention>Nastasya Petrovna</mention> talked in a low voice, and was continually dropping her thimble in her excitement; and <mention>Katka</mention> her granddaughter, crawled under the table after it and each time sat a long while under the table, probably examining Yegorushka's feet; and <mention>Yegorushka</mention> listened, half dozing and looking at the old woman's face, her wart with hairs on it, and the stains of tears, and he felt sad, very sad. He was put to sleep on a chest and told that if he were hungry in the night he must go out into the little passage and take some chicken, put there under a plate in the window.

Next morning <mention>Ivan Ivanitch</mention> and <mention>Father Christopher</mention> came to say good-bye. <mention>Nastasya Petrovna</mention> was delighted to see them, and was about to set the samovar; but <mention connection="s26834" id="s26908" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Ivan Ivanitch</mention>, who was in a great hurry, waved his hands and said:

<quote connection="s26908" id="s26834" oid="619" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"We have no time for tea! We are just setting off."</quote>

Before parting they all sat down and were silent for a minute. <mention>Nastasya Petrovna</mention> heaved a deep sigh and looked towards the ikon with tear-stained eyes.

<quote connection="s26909" id="s26835" oid="620" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"Well,"</quote> began <mention connection="s26835,s26836" id="s26909" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Ivan Ivanitch</mention>, getting up, <quote connection="s26909" id="s26836" oid="621" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"so you will stay. . . ."</quote>

All at once the look of business-like reserve vanished from his face; <mention connection="s26837" id="s26910" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">he</mention> flushed a little and said with a mournful smile:

<quote connection="s26910" id="s26837" oid="622" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"Mind you work hard. . . . Don't forget your mother, and obey <mention>Nastasya Petrovna</mention>. . . . If you are diligent at school, Yegor, I'll stand by you."</quote>

He took his purse out of his pocket, turned his back to <mention>Yegorushka</mention>, fumbled for a long time among the smaller coins, and, finding a ten-kopeck piece, gave it to <mention>Yegorushka</mention>.

<mention>Father Christopher</mention>, without haste, blessed <mention>Yegorushka</mention>.

<quote connection="s26911" id="s26838" oid="623" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. . . . Study,"</quote> <mention connection="s26838,s26839" id="s26911" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">he </mention>said. <quote connection="s26911" id="s26839" oid="624" speaker="Father_Christopher_Siriysky">"Work hard, my lad. If I die, remember me in your prayers. Here is a ten-kopeck piece from me, too. . . ."</quote>

Yegorushka kissed his hand, and shed tears; something whispered in his heart that he would never see the old man again.

<quote connection="s26912" id="s26840" oid="625" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"I have applied at the high school already,"</quote> said <mention connection="s26840,s26841" id="s26912" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">Ivan Ivanitch</mention> in <mention>a voice</mention> as though there were a corpse in the room. <quote connection="s26912" id="s26841" oid="626" speaker="Ivan_Kuzmichov">"You will take him for the entrance examination on the seventh of August. . . . Well, good-bye; God bless you, good-bye, Yegor!"</quote>

<quote connection="s26913" id="s26842" oid="627" speaker="Nastasya_Petrovna">"You might at least have had a cup of tea,"</quote> wailed <mention connection="s26842" id="s26913" speaker="Nastasya_Petrovna">Nastasya Petrovna</mention>.

Through the tears that filled his eyes <mention>Yegorushka</mention> could not see his uncle and <mention>Father Christopher</mention> go out. He rushed to the window, but they were not in the yard, and the red dog, who had just been barking, was running back from the gate with the air of having done his duty. When <mention>Yegorushka</mention> ran out of the gate <mention>Ivan Ivanitch</mention> and <mention>Father Christopher</mention>, the former waving his stick with the crook, the latter his staff, were just turning the corner. <mention>Yegorushka</mention> felt that with these people all that he had known till then had vanished from him for ever. He sank helplessly on to the little bench, and with bitter tears greeted the new unknown life that was beginning for him now. . . .

What would that life be like?</chapter></text>
