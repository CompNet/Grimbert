CHAPTER I

<mention>Emma Woodhouse</mention>, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.

She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate, indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister's marriage, been mistress of his house from a very early period.  Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.

Sixteen years had <mention>Miss Taylor</mention> been in Mr. Woodhouse's family, less as a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly of <mention>Emma</mention>.  Between them it was more the intimacy of sisters.  Even before <mention>Miss Taylor</mention> had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached, and <mention>Emma</mention> doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, but directed chiefly by her own.

The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of having rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments.  The danger, however, was at present so unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her.

Sorrow came--a gentle sorrow-- but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness.-- Miss Taylor married.  It was Miss Taylor's loss which first brought grief.  It was on the wedding-day of this beloved friend that <mention>Emma</mention> first sat in mournful thought of any continuance.  The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her father and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening.  Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost.

The event had every promise of happiness for her friend.  <mention>Mr. Weston</mention> was <mention>a man</mention> of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for her.  The want of <mention>Miss Taylor</mention> would be felt every hour of every day.  She recalled her past kindness-- the kindness, the affection of sixteen years-- how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old-- how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health-- and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood.  A large debt of gratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella's marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection.  She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of hers-- one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault.

How was she to bear the change?-- It was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them; but <mention>Emma</mention> was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude.  She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her.  He could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful.

The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and <mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention> had not married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits; for having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity of mind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time.

Her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her daily reach; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit from <mention>Isabella</mention> and her husband, and their little children, to fill the house, and give her pleasant society again.

Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town, to which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and name, did really belong, afforded her no equals.  The Woodhouses were first in consequence there.  All looked up to them.  She had many acquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil, but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of <mention>Miss Taylor</mention> for even half a day.  It was a melancholy change; and <mention>Emma</mention> could not but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful.  His spirits required support. He was a nervous man, easily depressed; fond of every body that he was used to, and hating to part with them; hating change of every kind. Matrimony, as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her but with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection, when he was now obliged to part with <mention>Miss Taylor</mention> too; and from his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself, he was very much disposed to think <mention>Miss Taylor</mention> had done as sad a thing for herself as for them, and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield.  <mention connection="s261,s263,s265,s267" entity="person20" entitytype="PERSON" gender="female" id="s64" mentiontype="name" oid="named30" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">Emma</mention> smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible for him not to say exactly as <mention connection="s260" id="s310" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">he</mention> had said at dinner,

<quote connection="s310" id="s260" oid="0" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse" addressees="Emma_Woodhouse">"Poor Miss Taylor!--I wish she were here again.  What a pity it is that <mention>Mr. Weston</mention> ever thought of her!"</quote>

<quote connection="s64" id="s261" mention="named30" oid="1" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse" addressees="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">"I cannot agree with you, <mention connection="s262,s264" id="s311" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">papa</mention>; you know I cannot.  <mention>Mr. Weston</mention> is such a good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves a good wife;-- and you would not have had <mention>Miss Taylor</mention> live with us for ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her own?"</quote>

<quote connection="s311" id="s262" mention="organism32" oid="2" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse" addressees="Emma_Woodhouse">"A house of her own!-- But where is the advantage of a house of her own? This is three times as large.-- And you have never any odd humours, my dear."</quote>

<quote connection="s64" id="s263" mention="named30" oid="3" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse" addressees="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">"How often <mention>we</mention> shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!-- We shall be always meeting! We must begin; <mention>we</mention> must go and pay wedding visit very soon."</quote>

<quote connection="s311" id="s264" mention="organism32" oid="4" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse" addressees="Emma_Woodhouse">"My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance.  I could not walk half so far."</quote>

<quote connection="s64" id="s265" mention="named30" oid="5" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse" addressees="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">"No, <mention connection="s266" id="s312" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">papa</mention>, nobody thought of your walking.  We must go in the carriage, to be sure."</quote>

<quote connection="s312" id="s266" mention="organism32" oid="6" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse" addressees="Emma_Woodhouse">"The carriage! But <mention>James</mention> will not like to put the horses to for such a little way;-- and where are the poor horses to be while <mention>we</mention> are paying our visit?"</quote>

<quote connection="s64" id="s267" mention="named30" oid="7" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse" addressees="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">"They are to be put into Mr. Weston's stable, papa.  You know <mention>we</mention> have settled all that already.  We talked it all over with <mention>Mr. Weston</mention> last night.  And as for <mention>James</mention>, you may be very sure he will always like going to Randalls, because of his daughter's being housemaid there.  I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else.  That was your doing, <mention connection="s268" id="s313" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">papa</mention>.  You got <mention>Hannah</mention> that good place.  Nobody thought of <mention>Hannah</mention> till you mentioned her-- <mention>James</mention> is so obliged to you!"</quote>

<quote connection="s313" id="s268" mention="organism32" oid="8" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse" addressees="Emma_Woodhouse">"I am very glad I did think of her.  It was very lucky, for I would not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I am sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil, pretty-spoken girl; I have a great opinion of her.  Whenever I see her, she always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when you have had her here to do needlework, I observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it.  I am sure she will be an excellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see.  Whenever <mention>James</mention> goes over to see his daughter, you know, she will be hearing of us.  He will be able to tell her how <mention>we</mention> all are."</quote>

Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably through the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own.  The backgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary.

<mention>Mr. Knightley</mention>, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly connected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella's husband.  He lived about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome, and at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their mutual connexions in London.  He had returned to a late dinner, after some days' absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square.  It was a happy circumstance, and animated <mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention> for some time.  <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention> had a cheerful manner, which always did him good; and his many inquiries after <quote connection="" id="s269" oid="9" speaker="none" addressees="">"poor Isabella"</quote> and her children were answered most satisfactorily.  When this was over, <mention connection="s270" id="s317" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">Mr. Woodhouse</mention> gratefully observed, <quote connection="s317" id="s270" mention="named65" oid="10" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse" addressees="Mr_George_Knightley">"It is very kind of you, <mention connection="s271,s273,s275,s277" id="s315" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">Mr. Knightley</mention>, to come out at this late hour to call upon us.  I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk."</quote>

<quote connection="s315" id="s271" mention="named67" oid="11" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley" addressees="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">"Not at all, <mention connection="s272" id="s316" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">sir</mention>.  It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire."</quote>

<quote connection="s316" id="s272" mention="named65" oid="12" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse" addressees="Mr_George_Knightley">"But you must have found it very damp and dirty.  I wish you may not catch cold."</quote>

<quote connection="s315" id="s273" mention="named67" oid="13" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley" addressees="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">"Dirty, <mention connection="s274,s276" id="s318" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">sir</mention>! Look at my shoes.  Not a speck on them."</quote>

<quote connection="s318" id="s274" mention="named65" oid="14" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse" addressees="Mr_John_Knightley">"Well! that is quite surprising, for <mention>we</mention> have had a vast deal of rain here.  It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while <mention>we</mention> were at breakfast.  I wanted them to put off the wedding."</quote>

<quote connection="s315" id="s275" mention="named67" oid="15" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley" addressees="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse;Emma_Woodhouse">"By the bye--I have not wished you joy.  Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well.  How did you all behave? Who cried most?"</quote>

<quote connection="s318" id="s276" mention="named65" oid="16" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse" addressees="Mr_George_Knightley">"Ah! poor Miss Taylor! 'Tis a sad business."</quote>

<quote connection="s315" id="s277" mention="named67" oid="17" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley" addressees="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse;Emma_Woodhouse">"Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but <mention connection="s278" id="s319" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">I</mention> cannot possibly say <quote connection="s319" id="s278" oid="" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley" addressees="">'poor Miss Taylor.'</quote> I have a great regard for you and <mention>Emma</mention>; but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!-- At any rate, it must be better to have only one to please than two."</quote>

<quote connection="s140" id="s279" mention="named87" oid="18" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse" addressees="Mr_George_Knightley">"Especially when one of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome creature!"</quote> said <mention connection="s279,s280,s283" entity="person20" entitytype="PERSON" gender="female" id="s140" mentiontype="name" oid="named87" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">Emma</mention> playfully.  <quote connection="s140" id="s280" mention="named87" oid="19" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse" addressees="Mr_George_Knightley">"That is what you have in your head, I know-- and what you would certainly say if my father were not by."</quote>

<quote connection="s145" id="s281" mention="named89" oid="20" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse" addressees="Emma_Woodhouse">"I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,"</quote> said <mention connection="s281,s282" entity="person5" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s145" mentiontype="name" oid="named89" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">Mr. Woodhouse</mention>, with a sigh.  <quote connection="s145" id="s282" mention="named89" oid="21" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse" addressees="Emma_Woodhouse">"I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome."</quote>

<quote connection="s140" id="s283" mention="named87" oid="22" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse" addressees="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">"My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean you, or suppose <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention> to mean you.  What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant only myself.  <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention> loves to find fault with me, you know-- in a joke-- it is all a joke.  We always say what <mention>we</mention> like to one another."</quote>

Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults in <mention>Emma Woodhouse</mention>, and the only one who ever told her of them: and though this was not particularly agreeable to <mention>Emma</mention> herself, she knew it would be so much less so to her father, that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body.

<quote connection="s160" id="s284" mention="named100" oid="23" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley" addressees="Emma_Woodhouse;Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">"<mention>Emma</mention> knows I never flatter her,"</quote> said <mention connection="s284,s285" entity="person6" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s160" mentiontype="name" oid="named100" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">Mr. Knightley</mention>, <quote connection="s160" id="s285" mention="named100" oid="24" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley" addressees="Emma_Woodhouse;Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">"but I meant no reflection on any body.  <mention>Miss Taylor</mention> has been used to have two persons to please; she will now have but one.

Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks: not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen.  Oh no; <mention>we</mention> all felt that <mention>we</mention> were going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting every day."</quote>

<quote connection="s168" id="s288" mention="organism62" oid="27" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse" addressees="Mr_George_Knightley">"Dear Emma bears every thing so well,"</quote> said <mention class="father" connection="s288,s289" entity="organism62" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s168" mentiontype="nominal" modifier="" oid="organism62" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">her father</mention>.  <quote connection="s168" id="s289" mention="organism62" oid="28" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse" addressees="Mr_George_Knightley">"But, Mr. Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am sure she will miss her more than she thinks for."</quote>

Emma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles.  <quote connection="s175" id="s290" mention="named111" oid="29" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley" addressees="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">"It is impossible that <mention>Emma</mention> should not miss such a companion,"</quote> said <mention connection="s290,s291" entity="person6" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s175" mentiontype="name" oid="named111" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">Mr. Knightley</mention>.  <quote connection="s175" id="s291" mention="named111" oid="30" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley" addressees="Mr_George_Knightley">"We should not like her so well as <mention>we</mention> do, sir, if <mention>we</mention> could suppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor's advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor's time of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure.  Every friend of <mention>Miss Taylor</mention> must be glad to have her so happily married."</quote>

<quote connection="s181" id="s292" mention="named118" oid="31" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse" addressees="Mr_George_Knightley">"And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,"</quote> said <mention connection="s292,s293,s295,s305,s300" entity="person20" entitytype="PERSON" gender="female" id="s181" mentiontype="name" oid="named118" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">Emma</mention>, <quote connection="s181" id="s293" mention="named118" oid="32" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse" addressees="Mr_George_Knightley">"and a very considerable one-- that I made the match myself.

Mr. Knightley shook his head at her.  <mention class="father" connection="s294" entity="organism67" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s187" mentiontype="nominal" modifier="" oid="organism67" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">Her father</mention> fondly replied, <quote connection="s187" id="s294" mention="organism67" oid="33" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse" addressees="Emma_Woodhouse">"Ah! my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for whatever you say always comes to pass.

Oh no! <mention>Mr. Weston</mention> certainly would never marry again.  Some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed, and others of the son and the uncle not letting him.  All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject, but I believed <mention>none</mention> of it.  Ever since the day-- about four years ago-- that <mention>Miss Taylor</mention> and I met with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he darted away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from Farmer Mitchell's, I made up my mind on the subject.

<mention>Mr. Weston</mention> was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family, which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property.  He had received a good education, but, on succeeding early in life to a small independence, had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged, and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county, then embodied.

Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to <mention>Miss Churchill</mention>, of a great Yorkshire family, and <mention>Miss Churchill</mention> fell in love with him, nobody was surprized, except her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, and who were full of pride and importance, which the connexion would offend.

<mention>Miss Churchill</mention>, however, being of age, and with the full command of her fortune-- though her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate-- was not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to the infinite mortification of Mr. and <mention>Mrs. Churchill</mention>, who threw her off with due decorum.  It was an unsuitable connexion, and did not produce much happiness.  <mention>Mrs. Weston</mention> ought to have found more in it, for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him; but though she had one sort of spirit, she had not the best.  She had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother, but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother's unreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her former home.  They lived beyond their income, but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe: she did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at once to be the wife of Captain Weston, and <mention>Miss Churchill</mention> of Enscombe.

Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills, as making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst of the bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years' marriage, he was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain. From the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved.  The boy had, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother's, been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr. and <mention>Mrs. Churchill</mention>, having no children of their own, nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for, offered to take the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease.  Some scruples and some reluctance the widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as they were overcome by other considerations, the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills, and he had only his own comfort to seek, and his own situation to improve as he could.

A complete change of life became desirable.  He quitted the militia and engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good way in London, which afforded him a favourable opening.  It was a concern which brought just employment enough.  He had still a small house in Highbury, where most of his leisure days were spent; and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away.  He had, by that time, realised an easy competence-- enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury, which he had always longed for-- enough to marry <mention>a woman</mention> as portionless even as <mention>Miss Taylor</mention>, and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition.

It was now some time since <mention>Miss Taylor</mention> had begun to influence his schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth, it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to; but he had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they were accomplished.  He had made his fortune, bought his house, and obtained his wife; and was beginning a new period of existence, with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through.  He had never been an unhappy man; his own temper had secured him from that, even in his first marriage; but his second must shew him how delightful a well-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.

He had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was his own; for as to <mention>Frank</mention>, it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle's heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age.  It was most unlikely, therefore, that he should ever want his father's assistance.  His father had no apprehension of it.  The aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her husband entirely; but it was not in Mr. Weston's nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he believed, so deservedly dear.  He saw his son every year in London, and was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too.  He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern.

<mention>Mr. Frank Churchill</mention> was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life.  His coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved.

Now, upon his father's marriage, it was very generally proposed, as a most proper attention, that the visit should take place.  There was not a dissentient voice on the subject, either when <mention>Mrs. Perry</mention> drank tea with Mrs. and <mention>Miss Bates</mention>, or when Mrs. and <mention>Miss Bates</mention> returned the visit.  Now was the time for <mention>Mr. Frank Churchill</mention> to come among them; and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion.  For a few days, every morning visit in Highbury included <mention connection="s1730" id="s1732" speaker="some_mention">some mention</mention> of the handsome letter <mention>Mrs. Weston</mention> had received.  <quote connection="s1732" id="s1730" oid="0" speaker="some_mention">"I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter <mention>Mr. Frank Churchill</mention> has written to <mention>Mrs. Weston</mention>? I understand it was a very handsome letter, indeed.  <mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention> told me of it.  <mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention> saw the letter, and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life."</quote>

It was, indeed, a highly prized letter.  <mention>Mrs. Weston</mention> had, of course, formed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense, and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured.  She felt herself a most fortunate woman; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought, where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled, and who could ill bear to part with her.

She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think, without pain, of <mention>Emma</mention>'s losing a single pleasure, or suffering an hour's ennui, from the want of her companionableness: but dear Emma was of no feeble character; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been, and had sense, and energy, and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations.  And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield, so convenient for even solitary female walking, and in Mr. Weston's disposition and circumstances, which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together.

Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to <mention>Mrs. Weston</mention>, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction-- her more than satisfaction-- her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent, that Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity 'poor Miss Taylor,' when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own.  But never did she go without <mention connection="s1731" entity="person14" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s420" mentiontype="name" oid="named48" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">Mr. Woodhouse</mention>'s giving a gentle sigh, and saying, <quote connection="s420" id="s1731" mention="named48" oid="1" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">"Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She would be very glad to stay."</quote>

There was no recovering Miss Taylor-- nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to <mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention>. The compliments of his neighbours were over; he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, which had been a great distress to him, was all eat up.  His own stomach could bear nothing rich, and he could never believe other people to be different from himself.  What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body; and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as earnestly tried to prevent any body's eating it.  He had been at the pains of consulting <mention>Mr. Perry</mention>, the apothecary, on the subject.  <mention>Mr. Perry</mention> was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse's life; and upon being applied to, he could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with many-- perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately.  With such an opinion, in confirmation of his own, <mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention> hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair; but still the cake was eaten; and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone.

There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston's wedding-cake in their hands: but <mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention> would never believe it.</chapter><chapter>CHAPTER III

<mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention> was fond of society in his own way.  He liked very much to have his friends come and see him; and from various united causes, from his long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature, from his fortune, his house, and his daughter, he could command the visits of his own little circle, in a great measure, as he liked.  He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle; his horror of late hours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms.  Fortunately for him, Highbury, including Randalls in the same parish, and Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining, the seat of <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention>, comprehended many such.  Not unfrequently, through Emma's persuasion, he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him: but evening parties were what he preferred; and, unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company, there was scarcely an evening in the week in which <mention>Emma</mention> could not make up a card-table for him.

Real, long-standing regard brought the Westons and <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention>; and by <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse's drawing-room, and the smiles of his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.

After these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom were Mrs. and <mention>Miss Bates</mention>, and <mention>Mrs. Goddard</mention>, three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield, and who were fetched and carried home so often, that <mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention> thought it no hardship for either James or the horses.  Had it taken place only once a year, it would have been a grievance.

<mention>Mrs. Bates</mention>, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very old lady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille.  She lived with her single daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untoward circumstances, can excite.  Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for <mention>a woman</mention> neither young, handsome, rich, nor married. <mention>Miss Bates</mention> stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour; and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself, or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect.  She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness. Her youth had passed without distinction, and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible.  And yet she was a happy woman, and <mention>a woman</mention> whom no one named without good-will.  It was her own universal good-will and contented temper which worked such wonders.  She loved every body, was interested in every body's happiness, quicksighted to every body's merits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother, and so many good neighbours and friends, and a home that wanted for nothing.  The simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature, her contented and grateful spirit, were a recommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity to herself.  She was a great talker upon little matters, which exactly suited <mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention>, full of trivial communications and harmless gossip.

<mention>Mrs. Goddard</mention> was the mistress of a School-- not of a seminary, or an establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of refined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality, upon new principles and new systems-- and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity-- but a real, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where girls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves into a little education, without any danger of coming back prodigies.  Mrs. Goddard's school was in high repute-- and very deservedly; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house and garden, gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about a great deal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands.  It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church.  She was a plain, motherly kind of woman, who had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to Mr. Woodhouse's kindness, felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she could, and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside.

These were the ladies whom <mention>Emma</mention> found herself very frequently able to collect; and happy was she, for her father's sake, in the power; though, as far as she was herself concerned, it was no remedy for the absence of <mention>Mrs. Weston</mention>.  She was delighted to see her father look comfortable, and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated.

As she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day, a note was brought from <mention>Mrs. Goddard</mention>, requesting, in most respectful terms, to be allowed to bring <mention>Miss Smith</mention> with her; a most welcome request: for <mention>Miss Smith</mention> was a girl of seventeen, whom <mention>Emma</mention> knew very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in, on account of her beauty.  A very gracious invitation was returned, and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.

<mention>Harriet Smith</mention> was the natural daughter of somebody.  Somebody had placed her, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard's school, and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour-boarder. This was all that was generally known of her history. She had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury, and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her.

She was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort which <mention>Emma</mention> particularly admired.  She was short, plump, and fair, with a fine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look of great sweetness, and, before the end of the evening, <mention>Emma</mention> was as much pleased with her manners as her person, and quite determined to continue the acquaintance.

She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith's conversation, but she found her altogether very engaging-- not inconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk-- and yet so far from pushing, shewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to, that she must have good sense, and deserve encouragement. Encouragement should be given.  Those soft blue eyes, and all those natural graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions.  The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her.  The friends from whom she had just parted, though very good sort of people, must be doing her harm.  They were a family of the name of Martin, whom <mention>Emma</mention> well knew by character, as renting a large farm of <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention>, and residing in the parish of Donwell-- very creditably, she believed-- she knew <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention> thought highly of them-- but they must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect.  She would notice her; she would improve her; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her into good society; she would form her opinions and her manners.  It would be an interesting, and certainly a very kind undertaking; highly becoming her own situation in life, her leisure, and powers.

She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking and listening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table, which always closed such parties, and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved forwards to the fire, before she was aware.  With an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively, with the real good-will of a mind delighted with its own ideas, did she then do all the honours of the meal, and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters, with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests.

Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare. He loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion of his youth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing, his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat.

Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though <mention connection="s3142" id="s3143" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">he</mention> might constrain himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things, to say:

<quote connection="s3143" id="s3142" mention="named108" oid="2" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">"Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs.  An egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome.  Serle understands boiling an egg better than any body.  I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small, you see-- one of our small eggs will not hurt you.  Miss Bates, let <mention>Emma</mention> help you to a little bit of tart -- a very little bit.  Ours are all apple-tarts. You need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here.  I do not advise the custard.  Mrs. Goddard, what say you to half a glass of wine? A small half-glass, put into a tumbler of water? I do not think it could disagree with you."</quote>

Emma allowed her father to talk-- but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy.  The happiness of <mention>Miss Smith</mention> was quite equal to her intentions.  <mention>Miss Woodhouse</mention> was so great a personage in Highbury, that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure; but the humble, grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings, delighted with the affability with which <mention>Miss Woodhouse</mention> had treated her all the evening, and actually shaken hands with her at last!</chapter><chapter>CHAPTER III

<mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention> was fond of society in his own way.  He liked very much to have his friends come and see him; and from various united causes, from his long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature, from his fortune, his house, and his daughter, he could command the visits of his own little circle, in a great measure, as he liked.

They were a family of the name of Martin, whom <mention>Emma</mention> well knew by character, as renting a large farm of <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention>, and residing in the parish of Donwell-- very creditably, she believed-- she knew <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention> thought highly of them-- but they must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect.  She would notice her; she would improve her; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her into good society; she would form her opinions and her manners.  It would be an interesting, and certainly a very kind undertaking; highly becoming her own situation in life, her leisure, and powers.

She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking and listening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table, which always closed such parties, and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved forwards to the fire, before she was aware.  With an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively, with the real good-will of a mind delighted with its own ideas, did she then do all the honours of the meal, and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters, with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests.

Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare. He loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion of his youth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing, his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat.

Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though <mention connection="s4553" id="s4554" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">he</mention> might constrain himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things, to say:

<quote connection="s4554" id="s4553" mention="named108" oid="2" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">"Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs.  An egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome.  Serle understands boiling an egg better than any body.  I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small, you see-- one of our small eggs will not hurt you.  Miss Bates, let <mention>Emma</mention> help you to a little bit of tart -- a very little bit.  Ours are all apple-tarts. You need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here.  I do not advise the custard.  Mrs. Goddard, what say you to half a glass of wine? A small half-glass, put into a tumbler of water? I do not think it could disagree with you."</quote>

Emma allowed her father to talk-- but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy.  The happiness of <mention>Miss Smith</mention> was quite equal to her intentions.  <mention>Miss Woodhouse</mention> was so great a personage in Highbury, that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure; but the humble, grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings, delighted with the affability with which <mention>Miss Woodhouse</mention> had treated her all the evening, and actually shaken hands with her at last!</chapter><chapter>CHAPTER V

How can <mention>Emma</mention> imagine she has any thing to learn herself, while <mention>Harriet</mention> is presenting such a delightful inferiority? And as for <mention>Harriet</mention>, I will venture to say that she cannot gain by the acquaintance.  Hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to.  She will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home.

Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and <mention>Mr. Weston</mention>'s on the subject, as much as possible.

Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made; and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others.  <mention>Emma</mention> wished to go to work directly, and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that they might decide together on the best size for <mention>Harriet</mention>.  Her many beginnings were displayed.  Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths, pencil, crayon, and water-colours had been all tried in turn.  She had always wanted to do every thing, and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to.  She played and sang;-- and drew in almost every style; but steadiness had always been wanting; and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command, and ought not to have failed of.  She was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist or a musician, but she was not unwilling to have others deceived, or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher than it deserved.

There was merit in every drawing-- in the least finished, perhaps the most; her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had there been ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same.  They were both in ecstasies.  A likeness pleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse's performances must be capital.

Dear Mrs. Weston! always my kindest friend on every occasion.  She would sit whenever I asked her.  There is my sister; and really quite her own little elegant figure!-- and the face not unlike.  I should have made a good likeness of her, if she would have sat longer, but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet.  Then, here come all my attempts at three of those four children;-- there they are, Henry and John and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other, and any one of them might do for any one of the rest.  She was so eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless they are coarser featured than any of mama's children ever were. Here is my sketch of the fourth, who was a baby.  I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see.

But for Harriet's sake, or rather for my own, and as there are no husbands and wives in the case at present, I will break my resolution now."</quote>

<mention connection="s7570" entity="person41" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s6868" mentiontype="name" oid="named532" speaker="Mr_Elton">Mr. Elton</mention> seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea, and was repeating, <quote connection="s6868" id="s7570" mention="named532" oid="101" speaker="Mr_Elton">"No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed, as you observe.  Exactly so.  No husbands and wives,"</quote> with so interesting a consciousness, that <mention>Emma</mention> began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once.  But as she wanted to be drawing, the declaration must wait a little longer.

She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait.  It was to be a whole-length in water-colours, like <mention>Mr. John Knightley</mention>'s, and was destined, if she could please herself, to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece.

The sitting began; and <mention>Harriet</mention>, smiling and blushing, and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist.  But there was no doing any thing, with <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> fidgeting behind her and watching every touch.  <mention connection="s7571" id="s7600" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">She</mention> gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence; but was really obliged to put an end to it, and request him to place himself elsewhere.  It then occurred to her to employ him in reading.

<quote connection="s7600" id="s7571" mention="named536" oid="102" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness indeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessen the irksomeness of <mention>Miss Smith</mention>'s."</quote>

Mr. Elton was only too happy.  <mention>Harriet</mention> listened, and <mention>Emma</mention> drew in peace.  She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look; any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover; and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil, to jump up and see the progress, and be charmed.-- There was no being displeased with such an encourager, for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible.  She could not respect his eye, but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable.

The sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite enough pleased with the first day's sketch to wish to go on.  There was no want of likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude, and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure, to give a little more height, and considerably more elegance, she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last, and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both -- a standing memorial of the beauty of one, the skill of the other, and the friendship of both; with as many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton's very promising attachment was likely to add.

The same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction, took place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress of the picture, which was rapid and happy.

The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a few difficulties.  It must be done directly; it must be done in London; the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be depended on; and <mention>Isabella</mention>, the usual doer of all commissions, must not be applied to, because it was December, and <mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention> could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of December.

<mention>Mr. Elton</mention> was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame, and give the directions; and <mention>Emma</mention> thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him, while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough.

The very day of <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>'s going to London produced a fresh occasion for Emma's services towards her friend.  <mention>Harriet</mention> had been at Hartfield, as usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home to return again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had been talked of, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell.  Half a minute brought it all out.  She had heard, as soon as she got back to <mention>Mrs. Goddard</mention>'s, that <mention>Mr. Martin</mention> had been there an hour before, and finding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away; and on opening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two songs which she had lent <mention>Elizabeth</mention> to copy, a letter to herself; and this letter was from him, from <mention>Mr. Martin</mention>, and contained a direct proposal of marriage.  <quote connection="" id="s9136" mention="named590" oid="121" speaker="none">"Who could have thought it? She was so surprized she did not know what to do.  Yes, quite a proposal of marriage; and a very good letter, at least she thought so.  And he wrote as if he really loved her very much-- but she did not know-- and so, she was come as fast as she could to ask <mention>Miss Woodhouse</mention> what she should do. -- "</quote> Emma was half-ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful.

<quote connection="s9190" id="s9137" mention="named590" oid="122" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"Upon my word,"</quote> <mention connection="s9137,s9138" id="s9190" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">she</mention> cried, <quote connection="s9190" id="s9138" mention="named590" oid="123" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking.

<quote connection="s8497" id="s9139" mention="named591" oid="124" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"Will you read the letter?"</quote> cried <mention connection="s9139,s9140" entity="person48" entitytype="PERSON" gender="female" id="s8497" mentiontype="name" oid="named591" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">Harriet</mention>.  <quote connection="s8497" id="s9140" mention="named591" oid="125" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"Pray do.  I'd rather you would."</quote>

Emma was not sorry to be pressed.  She read, and was surprized.  The style of the letter was much above her expectation.  There were not merely no grammatical errors, but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman; the language, though plain, was strong and unaffected, and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer.  It was short, but expressed good sense, warm attachment, liberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling.  She paused over it, while <mention connection="s9142,s9141" entity="person48" entitytype="PERSON" gender="female" id="s8502" mentiontype="name" oid="named593" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">Harriet</mention> stood anxiously watching for her opinion, with a <quote connection="s8502" id="s9141" mention="named594" oid="126" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"Well, well,"</quote> and was at last forced to add, <quote connection="s8502" id="s9142" mention="named593" oid="127" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"Is it a good letter? or is it too short?"</quote>

<quote connection="s9191" id="s9143" mention="named597" oid="128" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"Yes, indeed, a very good letter,"</quote> replied <mention connection="s9143,s9144,s9147,s9149,s9151,s9153" id="s9191" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">Emma</mention> rather slowly-- <quote connection="s9191" id="s9144" oid="129" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"so good a letter, <mention>Harriet</mention>, that every thing considered, I think one of his sisters must have helped him.

You blush, Harriet.-- Does any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition? <mention>Harriet</mention>, Harriet, do not deceive yourself; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion.  At this moment whom are you thinking of?"</quote>

The symptoms were favourable.-- Instead of answering, <mention>Harriet</mention> turned away confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though the letter was still in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted about without regard.  <mention>Emma</mention> waited the result with impatience, but not without strong hopes.  At last, with some hesitation, <mention connection="s9166" entity="person48" entitytype="PERSON" gender="female" id="s8576" mentiontype="name" oid="named647" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">Harriet</mention> said--

Do you think I am right?"</quote>

<quote connection="s9196" id="s9167" mention="named648" oid="148" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just what you ought.  While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to myself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation in approving.  Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this.  It would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have been the consequence of your marrying <mention>Mr. Martin</mention>.  While you were in the smallest degree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would not influence; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me.  I could not have visited <mention>Mrs. Robert Martin</mention>, of Abbey-Mill Farm.  Now I am secure of you for ever."</quote>

Harriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck her forcibly.

<quote connection="s9197" id="s9168" mention="named667" oid="149" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"You could not have visited me!"</quote> <mention connection="s9168,s9169,s9171" id="s9197" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">she</mention> cried, looking aghast.  <quote connection="s9197" id="s9169" mention="named667" oid="150" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"No, to be sure you could not; but I never thought of that before.

<quote connection="s9198" id="s9170" oid="151" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; but it must have been.  You would have thrown yourself out of all good society.  I must have given you up."</quote>

<quote connection="s9197" id="s9171" mention="named667" oid="152" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"Dear me!-- How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed me never to come to Hartfield any more!"</quote>

However, I do really think <mention>Mr. Martin</mention> a very amiable young man, and have a great opinion of him; and his being so much attached to me-- and his writing such a letter-- but as to leaving you, it is what I would not do upon any consideration."</quote>

<quote connection="s9198" id="s9175" oid="156" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend.  We will not be parted.  A woman is not to marry <mention>a man</mention> merely because she is asked, or because he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter."</quote>

<quote connection="s8611" id="s9176" mention="named678" oid="157" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"Oh no;-- and it is but a short letter too."</quote>

<quote connection="s8611" id="s9178" mention="named678" oid="159" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"Oh! yes, very.  Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always happy with pleasant companions.  I am quite determined to refuse him. But how shall I do? What shall I say?"</quote>

Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer, and advised its being written directly, which was agreed to, in the hope of her assistance; and though <mention>Emma</mention> continued to protest against any assistance being wanted, it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence.  The looking over his letter again, in replying to it, had such a softening tendency, that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions; and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy, and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say, and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful, that <mention>Emma</mention> believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment, he would have been accepted after all.

This letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent.  The business was finished, and <mention>Harriet</mention> safe.  <mention connection="s9179,s9181,s9182" id="s9199" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">She</mention> was rather low all the evening, but <mention connection="s9180,s9183" id="s9200" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">Emma</mention> could allow for her amiable regrets, and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection, sometimes by bringing forward the idea of <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>.

<quote connection="s9199" id="s9179" mention="named693" oid="160" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again,"</quote> was said in rather a sorrowful tone.

<quote connection="s9200" id="s9180" mention="named695" oid="161" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet.  You are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to Abbey-Mill."</quote>

<quote connection="s9199" id="s9181" mention="named694" oid="162" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy but at Hartfield."</quote>

Some time afterwards it was, <quote connection="s9199" id="s9182" mention="named695" oid="163" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"I think <mention>Mrs. Goddard</mention> would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened.  I am sure Miss Nash would-- for <mention>Miss Nash</mention> thinks her own sister very well married, and it is only a linen-draper."</quote>

<quote connection="s9200" id="s9183" mention="named695" oid="164" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school, <mention>Harriet</mention>.  I dare say <mention>Miss Nash</mention> would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married.  Even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes.  As to any thing superior for you, I suppose she is quite in the dark.  The attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet.  Hitherto I fancy you and I are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves."</quote>

Harriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering that people should like her so much.  The idea of <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> was certainly cheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted again towards the rejected Mr. Martin.

<quote connection="s9201" id="s9184" mention="named720" oid="165" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"Now he has got my letter,"</quote> said <mention connection="s9184,s9185,s9188" id="s9201" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">she</mention> softly.  <quote connection="s9201" id="s9185" mention="named720" oid="166" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"I wonder what they are all doing-- whether his sisters know-- if he is unhappy, they will be unhappy too.

<quote connection="s8666" id="s9186" oid="167" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed,"</quote> cried <mention connection="s9187,s9186,s9189" entity="person63" entitytype="PERSON" gender="female" id="s8666" mentiontype="name" oid="named724" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">Emma</mention>.  <quote connection="s8666" id="s9187" mention="named724" oid="168" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"At this moment, perhaps, <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters, telling how much more beautiful is the original, and after being asked for it five or six times, allowing them to hear your name, your own dear name."</quote>

<quote connection="s9201" id="s9188" oid="169" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"My picture!-- But he has left my picture in Bond-street."</quote>

No, my dear little modest Harriet, depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond-street till just before he mounts his horse to-morrow.  It is his companion all this evening, his solace, his delight.  It opens his designs to his family, it introduces you among them, it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature, eager curiosity and warm prepossession.  How cheerful, how animated, how suspicious, how busy their imaginations all are!"</quote>

Harriet smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger.</chapter><chapter>CHAPTER VIII

<mention>Harriet</mention> slept at Hartfield that night.  For some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there, and gradually getting to have a bed-room appropriated to herself; and <mention>Emma</mention> judged it best in every respect, safest and kindest, to keep her with them as much as possible just at present.  She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to <mention>Mrs. Goddard</mention>'s, but it was then to be settled that she should return to Hartfield, to make a regular visit of some days.

While she was gone, <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention> called, and sat some time with <mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention> and <mention>Emma</mention>, till <mention connection="s10787" id="s10849" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">Mr. Woodhouse</mention>, who had previously made up his mind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it, and was induced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples of his own civility, to leave <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention> for that purpose.  <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention>, who had nothing of ceremony about him, was offering by his short, decided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other.

<quote connection="s10849" id="s10787" oid="171" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">"Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, <mention connection="s10788,s10790" id="s10852" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">Mr. Knightley</mention>, if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take Emma's advice and go out for a quarter of an hour.  As the sun is out, I believe I had better take my three turns while I can.  I treat you without ceremony, Mr. Knightley.  We invalids think <mention>we</mention> are privileged people."</quote>

<quote connection="s10852" id="s10788" oid="172" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">"<mention connection="s10789" id="s10850" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">My dear sir,</mention> do not make a stranger of me."</quote>

<quote connection="s10850" id="s10789" oid="173" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">"I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter.  <mention>Emma</mention> will be happy to entertain you.  And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my three turns-- my winter walk."</quote>

<quote connection="s10852" id="s10790" oid="174" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">"You cannot do better, <mention connection="s10791" id="s10851" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">sir</mention>."</quote>

<quote connection="s10853" id="s10792" oid="176" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">"Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I think the sooner you go the better.  I will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you."</quote>

Mr. Woodhouse at last was off; but <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention>, instead of being immediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined for more chat.  He began speaking of <mention>Harriet</mention>, and speaking of her with more voluntary praise than <mention connection="s10795,s10798,s10800,s10802" id="s10855" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">Emma</mention> had ever heard before.

<quote connection="s10854" id="s10793" oid="177" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">"I cannot rate her beauty as you do,"</quote> said <mention connection="s10793,s10794" id="s10854" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">he</mention>; <quote connection="s10854" id="s10794" oid="178" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">"but she is a pretty little creature, and I am inclined to think very well of her disposition.  Her character depends upon those she is with; but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman."</quote>

<quote connection="s10855" id="s10795" oid="179" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be wanting."</quote>

<quote connection="s10856" id="s10796" oid="180" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">"Come,"</quote> said <mention connection="s10796,s10797,s10801,s10799,s10803" id="s10856" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">he</mention>, <quote connection="s10856" id="s10797" oid="181" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">"you are anxious for a compliment, so I will tell you that you have improved her.  You have cured her of her school-girl's giggle; she really does you credit."</quote>

<quote connection="s10855" id="s10798" oid="182" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"Thank you.  I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may.  You do not often overpower me with it."</quote>

<quote connection="s10856" id="s10799" oid="183" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">"You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?"</quote>

<quote connection="s10855" id="s10800" oid="184" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"Almost every moment.  She has been gone longer already than she intended."</quote>

<quote connection="s10856" id="s10801" oid="185" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">"Something has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps."</quote>

<quote connection="s10856" id="s10803" oid="187" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">"<mention>Harriet</mention> may not consider every body tiresome that you would."</quote>

<mention connection="s10805,s10807" id="s10858" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">Emma</mention> knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore said nothing.  <mention connection="s10804,s10806" id="s10857" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">He</mention> presently added, with a smile,

<quote connection="s10857" id="s10804" oid="188" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">"I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you that I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage."</quote>

<quote connection="s10858" id="s10805" oid="189" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"Indeed! how so? of what sort?"</quote>

<quote connection="s10857" id="s10806" oid="190" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">"A very serious sort, I assure you;"</quote> still smiling.

<quote connection="s10858" id="s10807" oid="191" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"Very serious! I can think of but one thing-- Who is in love with her? Who makes you their confidant?"</quote>

Emma was more than half in hopes of <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>'s having dropt a hint. <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention> was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knew <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> looked up to him.

<quote connection="s10859" id="s10808" oid="192" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">"I have reason to think,"</quote> <mention connection="s10808,s10809,s10812" id="s10859" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">he</mention> replied, <quote connection="s10859" id="s10809" oid="193" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">"that <mention>Harriet Smith</mention> will soon have an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable quarter:-- <mention>Robert Martin</mention> is the man.  Her visit to Abbey-Mill, this summer, seems to have done his business.  He is desperately in love and means to marry her."</quote>

<quote connection="s10860" id="s10810" oid="194" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"He is very obliging,"</quote> said <mention connection="s10810,s10811" id="s10860" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">Emma</mention>; <quote connection="s10860" id="s10811" oid="195" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"but is he sure that <mention>Harriet</mention> means to marry him?"</quote>

<quote connection="s10859" id="s10812" oid="196" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">"Well, well, means to make her an offer then.  Will that do? He came to the Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it.  He knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family, and, I believe, considers me as one of his best friends.  He came to ask me whether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early; whether I thought her too young: in short, whether I approved his choice altogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered (especially since your making so much of her) as in a line of society above him.  I was very much pleased with all that he said. I never hear better sense from any one than <mention>Robert Martin</mention>.  He always speaks to the purpose; open, straightforward, and very well judging. He told me every thing; his circumstances and plans, and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage.  He is an excellent young man, both as son and brother.  I had no hesitation in advising him to marry.  He proved to me that he could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced he could not do better.  I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent him away very happy.  If he had never esteemed my opinion before, he would have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had.  This happened the night before last.  Now, as <mention>we</mention> may fairly suppose, he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs. Goddard's to-day; and she may be detained by a visitor, without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch."</quote>

<quote connection="s10861" id="s10813" oid="197" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"Pray, Mr. Knightley,"</quote> said <mention connection="s10813,s10814" id="s10861" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">Emma</mention>, who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech, <quote connection="s10861" id="s10814" oid="198" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"how do you know that <mention>Mr. Martin</mention> did not speak yesterday?"</quote>

<quote connection="s10862" id="s10815" oid="199" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">"Certainly,"</quote> replied <mention connection="s10815,s10816" id="s10862" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">he</mention>, surprized, <quote connection="s10862" id="s10816" oid="200" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">"I do not absolutely know it; but it may be inferred.

<quote connection="s10867" id="s10826" oid="210" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">"Not Harriet's equal!"</quote> exclaimed <mention connection="s10826,s10827,s10830" id="s10867" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">Mr. Knightley</mention> loudly and warmly; and with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, <quote connection="s10867" id="s10827" oid="211" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">"No, he is not her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation.  <mention>Emma</mention>, your infatuation about that girl blinds you.  What are Harriet Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any connexion higher than <mention>Robert Martin</mention>? She is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and certainly no respectable relations.  She is known only as parlour-boarder at a common school.  She is not a sensible girl, nor a girl of any information.  She has been taught nothing useful, and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself.  At her age she can have no experience, and with her little wit, is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her.  She is pretty, and she is good tempered, and that is all.  My only scruple in advising the match was on his account, as being beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him.  I felt that, as to fortune, in all probability he might do much better; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do worse.  But I could not reason so to <mention>a man</mention> in love, and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort of disposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led aright and turn out very well.  The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now) that there would be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck.  Even your satisfaction I made sure of.

I wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings.  I assure you mine are very different.  I must think your statement by no means fair. You are not just to Harriet's claims.

Her friends evidently thought this good enough for her; and it was good enough. She desired nothing better herself.  Till you chose to turn her into a friend, her mind had no distaste for her own set, nor any ambition beyond it.  She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer.  She had no sense of superiority then.  If she has it now, you have given it.

It was most convenient to <mention>Emma</mention> not to make a direct reply to this assertion; <mention connection="s10834" id="s10870" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">she</mention> chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again.

Harriet's claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them.  She is not a clever girl, but she has better sense than you are aware of, and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly.  Waiving that point, however, and supposing her to be, as you describe her, only pretty and good-natured, let me tell you, that in the degree she possesses them, they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general, for she is, in fact, a beautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of an hundred; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed; till they do fall in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome faces, a girl, with such loveliness as <mention>Harriet</mention>, has a certainty of being admired and sought after, of having the power of chusing from among many, consequently a claim to be nice.  Her good-nature, too, is not so very slight a claim, comprehending, as it does, real, thorough sweetness of temper and manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a great readiness to be pleased with other people.  I am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty, and such temper, the highest claims <mention>a woman</mention> could possess."</quote>

Vanity working on a weak head, produces every sort of mischief.  Nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high.  <mention>Miss Harriet Smith</mention> may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast, though she is a very pretty girl.  Men of sense, whatever you may chuse to say, do not want silly wives.  Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity-- and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in, when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed.  Let her marry <mention>Robert Martin</mention>, and she is safe, respectable, and happy for ever; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly, and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than <mention>a man</mention> of consequence and large fortune, she may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard's all the rest of her life-- or, at least, (for <mention>Harriet Smith</mention> is a girl who will marry somebody or other,) till she grow desperate, and is glad to catch at the old writing-master's son."</quote>

She must abide by the evil of having refused him, whatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself, I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little; but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do.  His appearance is so much against him, and his manner so bad, that if she ever were disposed to favour him, she is not now.  I can imagine, that before she had seen any body superior, she might tolerate him.  He was the brother of her friends, and he took pains to please her; and altogether, having seen nobody better (that must have been his great assistant) she might not, while she was at Abbey-Mill, find him disagreeable.

Emma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone.  She did not repent what she had done; she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general, which made her dislike having it so loudly against her; and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state, was very disagreeable. Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence, with only one attempt on Emma's side to talk of the weather, but he made no answer.  He was thinking.  The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words.

<quote connection="s10874" id="s10843" oid="226" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">"<mention>Robert Martin</mention> has no great loss-- if he can but think so; and I hope it will not be long before he does.

Emma laughed and disclaimed.  <mention connection="s10843,s10844" id="s10874" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">He</mention> continued,

<quote connection="s10875" id="s10845" oid="228" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"I am very much obliged to you,"</quote> said <mention connection="s10845,s10846" id="s10875" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">Emma</mention>, laughing again.  <quote connection="s10875" id="s10846" oid="229" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"If I had set my heart on Mr. Elton's marrying Harriet, it would have been very kind to open my eyes; but at present I only want to keep <mention>Harriet</mention> to myself.

<quote connection="s10876" id="s10847" oid="230" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">"Good morning to you,"</quote>-- said <mention connection="s10847" id="s10876" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">he</mention>, rising and walking off abruptly.  He was very much vexed.  He felt the disappointment of the young man, and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the sanction he had given; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the affair, was provoking him exceedingly.

<mention>Emma</mention> remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more indistinctness in the causes of her's, than in his.  She did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversary's wrong, as <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention>. He walked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her. She was not so materially cast down, however, but that a little time and the return of <mention>Harriet</mention> were very adequate restoratives.  <mention>Harriet</mention>'s staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy.  The possibility of the young man's coming to <mention>Mrs. Goddard</mention>'s that morning, and meeting with <mention>Harriet</mention> and pleading his own cause, gave alarming ideas.  The dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and when <mention>Harriet</mention> appeared, and in very good spirits, and without having any such reason to give for her long absence, she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind, and convinced her, that let <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention> think or say what he would, she had done nothing which woman's friendship and woman's feelings would not justify.

He had frightened her a little about <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>; but when she considered that <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention> could not have observed him as she had done, neither with the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tell herself, in spite of Mr. Knightley's pretensions) with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself, that he had spoken it hastily and in anger, she was able to believe, that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true, than what he knew any thing about.  He certainly might have heard <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> speak with more unreserve than she had ever done, and <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> might not be of an imprudent, inconsiderate disposition as to money matters; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them; but then, <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention> did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives.  <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention> saw no such passion, and of course thought nothing of its effects; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest; and more than a reasonable, becoming degree of prudence, she was very sure did not belong to <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>.

Harriet's cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back, not to think of <mention>Mr. Martin</mention>, but to talk of <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>.  <mention>Miss Nash</mention> had been telling her something, which she repeated immediately with great delight.  <mention>Mr. Perry</mention> had been to <mention>Mrs. Goddard</mention>'s to attend a sick child, and <mention>Miss Nash</mention> had seen him, and he had told <mention>Miss Nash</mention>, that as he was coming back yesterday from <mention>Clayton Park</mention>, he had met <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>, and found to his great surprize, that <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> was actually on his road to London, and not meaning to return till the morrow, though it was the whist-club night, which he had been never known to miss before; and <mention>Mr. Perry</mention> had remonstrated with him about it, and told him how shabby it was in him, their best player, to absent himself, and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day; but it would not do; <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> had been determined to go on, and had said in a very particular way indeed, that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world; and something about a very enviable commission, and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious.  <mention>Mr. Perry</mention> could not quite understand him, but he was very sure there must be a lady in the case, and he told him so; and <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> only looked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great spirits.  <mention connection="s10848" id="s10877" speaker="Miss_Nash">Miss Nash</mention> had told her all this, and had talked a great deal more about <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>; and said, looking so very significantly at her, <quote connection="s10877" id="s10848" oid="231" speaker="Miss_Nash">"that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be, but she only knew that any woman whom <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> could prefer, she should think the luckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt, <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness."</quote></chapter><chapter>CHAPTER IX

<mention>Mr. Knightley</mention> might quarrel with her, but <mention>Emma</mention> could not quarrel with herself.  He was so much displeased, that it was longer than usual before he came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet, his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven.  She was sorry, but could not repent.  On the contrary, her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days.

The Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after Mr. Elton's return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting-room, he got up to look at it, and sighed out his half sentences of admiration just as he ought; and as for Harriet's feelings, they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted.  <mention>Emma</mention> was soon perfectly satisfied of <mention>Mr. Martin</mention>'s being no otherwise remembered, than as he furnished a contrast with <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>, of the utmost advantage to the latter.

Her views of improving her little friend's mind, by a great deal of useful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than a few first chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow.  It was much easier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at Harriet's fortune, than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts; and the only literary pursuit which engaged <mention>Harriet</mention> at present, the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life, was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with, into a thin quarto of hot-pressed paper, made up by her friend, and ornamented with ciphers and trophies.

In this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon.  <mention>Miss Nash</mention>, head-teacher at <mention>Mrs. Goddard</mention>'s, had written out at least three hundred; and <mention>Harriet</mention>, who had taken the first hint of it from her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse's help, to get a great many more.  <mention>Emma</mention> assisted with her invention, memory and taste; and as <mention>Harriet</mention> wrote a very pretty hand, it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order, in form as well as quantity.

<mention connection="s13462,s13463" entity="entity18" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s10900" mentiontype="name" oid="named16" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">Mr. Woodhouse</mention> was almost as much interested in the business as the girls, and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in.  <quote connection="s10900" id="s13462" mention="named16" oid="0" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">"So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young-- he wondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time."</quote> And it always ended in <quote connection="s10900" id="s13463" mention="named16" oid="1" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">"Kitty, a fair but frozen maid."</quote>

His good friend <mention>Perry</mention>, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject, did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind; but he had desired <mention>Perry</mention> to be upon the watch, and as he went about so much, something, he thought, might come from that quarter.

It was by no means his daughter's wish that the intellects of Highbury in general should be put under requisition.  <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> was the only one whose assistance she asked.  He was invited to contribute any really good enigmas, charades, or conundrums that he might recollect; and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections; and at the same time, as she could perceive, most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant, nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass his lips.  They owed to him their two or three politest puzzles; and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled, and rather sentimentally recited, that well-known charade,

<null connection="" id="s2666" speaker="">My first doth affliction denote, Which my second is destin'd to feel And my whole is the best antidote That affliction to soften and heal.--</null>

made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already.

<quote connection="s13553" id="s13464" mention="named15" oid="2" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"Why will not you write one yourself for us, <mention connection="s13466,s13467" id="s13554" speaker="Mr_Elton">Mr. Elton</mention>?"</quote> said <mention connection="s13464,s13465" id="s13553" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">she</mention>; <quote connection="s13553" id="s13465" mention="named15" oid="3" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"that is the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be easier to you."</quote>

<quote connection="s13554" id="s13466" oid="4" speaker="Mr_Elton">"Oh no! he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind in his life.  The stupidest fellow!

The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration.  He called for a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing, as he said, a charade, which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady, the object of his admiration, but which, from his manner, <mention>Emma</mention> was immediately convinced must be his own.

<quote connection="s13555" id="s13468" mention="named19" oid="6" speaker="Mr_Elton">"I do not offer it for Miss Smith's collection,"</quote> said <mention connection="s13468,s13469" id="s13555" speaker="Mr_Elton">he</mention>.  <quote connection="s13555" id="s13469" mention="named19" oid="7" speaker="Mr_Elton">"Being my friend's, I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye, but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it."</quote>

The speech was more to <mention>Emma</mention> than to <mention>Harriet</mention>, which <mention>Emma</mention> could understand.  There was deep consciousness about him, and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend's.  He was gone the next moment:-- after another moment's pause,

<quote connection="s10927" id="s13470" mention="named33" oid="8" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"Take it,"</quote> said <mention connection="s13470,s13471" entity="entity3" entitytype="PERSON" gender="female" id="s10927" mentiontype="name" oid="named33" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">Emma</mention>, smiling, and pushing the paper towards Harriet-- <quote connection="s10927" id="s13471" mention="named33" oid="9" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"it is for you.

But <mention>Harriet</mention> was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma, never loth to be first, was obliged to examine it herself.

Your marrying will be equal to the match at Randalls.  There does seem to be a something in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction, and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow.

Harriet submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts, so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of love.  It seemed too precious an offering for any degree of publicity.

If he were, every thing else must give way; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his dining with him-- had made such a point of it, that he had promised him conditionally to come.

<mention>Emma</mention> thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their account; her father was sure of his rubber.

Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say.  <mention connection="s13540" id="s13584" speaker="Mr_Elton">He</mention> looked rather doubtingly-- rather confused; said something about <quote connection="s13584" id="s13540" mention="named224" oid="74" speaker="Mr_Elton">"honour,"</quote>-- glanced at <mention>Emma</mention> and at <mention>Harriet</mention>, and then seeing the book open on the table, took it up, and examined it very attentively.  With the view of passing off an awkward moment, <mention connection="s13541" entity="entity3" entitytype="PERSON" gender="female" id="s11210" mentiontype="name" oid="named227" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">Emma</mention> smilingly said,

<quote connection="s11210" id="s13541" mention="named227" oid="75" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two.  He may be sure of every woman's approbation while he writes with such gallantry."</quote>

<quote connection="s11213" id="s13542" mention="named228" oid="76" speaker="Mr_Elton">"I have no hesitation in saying,"</quote> replied <mention connection="s13542,s13543" entity="entity5" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s11213" mentiontype="name" oid="named228" speaker="Mr_Elton">Mr. Elton</mention>, though hesitating a good deal while he spoke; <quote connection="s11213" id="s13543" oid="77" speaker="Mr_Elton">"I have no hesitation in saying-- at least if my friend feels at all as I do -- I have not the smallest doubt that, could he see his little effusion honoured as I see it, (looking at the book again, and replacing it on the table), he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life."</quote>

After this speech he was gone as soon as possible.  <mention>Emma</mention> could not think it too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities, there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh.  She ran away to indulge the inclination, leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to Harriet's share.</chapter><chapter>CHAPTER X

Though now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise; and on the morrow, <mention>Emma</mention> had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family, who lived a little way out of Highbury.

Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane leading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street of the place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode of <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>.  A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed, and then, about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage, an old and not very good house, almost as close to the road as it could be.  It had no advantage of situation; but had been very much smartened up by the present proprietor; and, such as it was, there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing eyes.-- <mention connection="s16251" entity="entity3" entitytype="PERSON" gender="female" id="s13938" mentiontype="name" oid="named240" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">Emma</mention>'s remark was--

<quote connection="s13938" id="s16251" mention="named240" oid="78" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"There it is.  There go you and your riddle-book one of these days."</quote>-- <mention connection="s16252" entity="entity6" entitytype="PERSON" gender="female" id="s13939" mentiontype="name" oid="named241" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">Harriet</mention>'s was--

<quote connection="s13939" id="s16252" mention="named241" oid="79" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"Oh, what a sweet house!-- How very beautiful!-- There are the yellow curtains that <mention>Miss Nash</mention> admires so much."</quote>

<quote connection="s13942" id="s16253" mention="named244" oid="80" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"I do not often walk this way now,"</quote> said <mention connection="s16253,s16254" entity="entity3" entitytype="PERSON" gender="female" id="s13942" mentiontype="name" oid="named244" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">Emma</mention>, as they proceeded, <quote connection="s13942" id="s16254" mention="named244" oid="81" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"but then there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards of this part of Highbury."</quote>

Harriet, she found, had never in her life been within side the Vicarage, and her curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors and probabilities, <mention>Emma</mention> could only class it, as a proof of love, with <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>'s seeing ready wit in her.

<quote connection="s16287" id="s16255" mention="named249" oid="82" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"I wish <mention>we</mention> could contrive it,"</quote> said <mention connection="s16255,s16256" id="s16287" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">she</mention>; <quote connection="s16287" id="s16256" mention="named249" oid="83" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"but I cannot think of any tolerable pretence for going in;-- no servant that I want to inquire about of his housekeeper-- no message from my father."</quote>

She pondered, but could think of nothing.  After a mutual silence of some minutes, <mention connection="s16257" id="s16288" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">Harriet</mention> thus began again--

<quote connection="s16288" id="s16257" mention="named253" oid="84" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married, or going to be married! so charming as you are!"</quote>--

And I am not only, not going to be married, at present, but have very little intention of ever marrying at all."</quote>

<quote connection="s16290" id="s16259" mention="named253" oid="86" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"Ah!-- so you say; but I cannot believe it."</quote>

<quote connection="s16289" id="s16291" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet, to be tempted; Mr. Elton, you know,</quote> (recollecting herself,) <quote connection="s16289" id="s16292" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">is out of the question:  and I do not wish to see any such person.  I would rather not be tempted.  I cannot really change for the better.  If I were to marry, I must expect to repent it."</quote>

<quote connection="s16290" id="s16261" mention="named253" oid="88" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"Dear me!-- it is so odd to hear <mention>a woman</mention> talk so!"</quote>--

<quote connection="s16289" id="s16262" mention="named256" oid="89" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"I have <mention>none</mention> of the usual inducements of women to marry.  Were I to fall in love, indeed, it would be a different thing!  but I never have been in love; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever shall.  And, without love, I am sure I should be a fool to change such a situation as mine.  Fortune I do not want; employment I do not want; consequence I do not want: I believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband's house as I am of Hartfield; and never, never could I expect to be so truly beloved and important; so always first and always right in any man's eyes as I am in my father's."</quote>

<quote connection="s16290" id="s16263" mention="named253" oid="90" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"But then, to be an old maid at last, like <mention>Miss Bates</mention>!"</quote>

<quote connection="s16289" id="s16264" mention="named256" oid="91" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"That is as formidable an image as you could present, <mention connection="s16265" id="s16293" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">Harriet</mention>; and if I thought I should ever be like <mention>Miss Bates</mention>! so silly-- so satisfied-- so smiling-- so prosing-- so undistinguishing and unfastidious-- and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me, I would marry to-morrow. But between us, I am convinced there never can be any likeness, except in being unmarried."</quote>

<quote connection="s16293" id="s16265" oid="92" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"But still, you will be an old maid! and that's so dreadful!"</quote>

<quote connection="s16289" id="s16266" mention="named256" oid="93" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"Never mind, <mention connection="s16267" id="s16294" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">Harriet</mention>, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public!  A single woman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous, disagreeable old maid! the proper sport of boys and girls, but a single woman, of good fortune, is always respectable, and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else.  And the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first; for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour the temper.  Those who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very small, and generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and cross.  This does not apply, however, to <mention>Miss Bates</mention>; she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very much to the taste of every body, though single and though poor. Poverty certainly has not contracted her mind:  I really believe, if she had only a shilling in the world, she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her:  that is a great charm."</quote>

<quote connection="s16294" id="s16267" oid="94" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself when you grow old?"</quote>

<quote connection="s16289" id="s16268" oid="95" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"If I know myself, <mention connection="s16269" id="s16295" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">Harriet</mention>, mine is an active, busy mind, with a great many independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty.  Woman's usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now; or with no important variation.  If I draw less, I shall read more; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work.  And as for objects of interest, objects for the affections, which is in truth the great point of inferiority, the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in not marrying, I shall be very well off, with all the children of a sister I love so much, to care about.  There will be enough of them, in all probability, to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need.  There will be enough for every hope and every fear; and though my attachment to <mention>none</mention> can equal that of a parent, it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder.  My nephews and nieces! -- I shall often have a niece with me."</quote>

<quote connection="s16295" id="s16269" oid="96" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"Do you know Miss Bates's niece?  That is, I know you must have seen her a hundred times-- but are you acquainted?"</quote>

<quote connection="s16289" id="s16270" oid="97" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"Oh! yes; <mention>we</mention> are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to Highbury.  By the bye, that is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece.  Heaven forbid! at least, that I should ever bore people half so much about all the Knightleys together, as she does about <mention>Jane Fairfax</mention>.  One is sick of the very name of <mention>Jane Fairfax</mention>. Every letter from her is read forty times over; her compliments to all friends go round and round again; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher, or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother, one hears of nothing else for a month.  I wish <mention>Jane Fairfax</mention> very well; but she tires me to death."</quote>

They were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics were superseded.  <mention>Emma</mention> was very compassionate; and the distresses of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness, her counsel and her patience, as from her purse.  She understood their ways, could allow for their ignorance and their temptations, had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy, and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good-will.  In the present instance, it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit; and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice, <mention connection="s16271" id="s16296" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">she</mention> quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as made her say to <mention>Harriet</mention>, as they walked away,

<quote connection="s16296" id="s16271" mention="named318" oid="98" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good.  How trifling they make every thing else appear! -- I feel now as if I could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet, who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind?"</quote>

<quote connection="s14053" id="s16272" mention="named322" oid="99" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"Very true,"</quote> said <mention connection="s16272,s16273" entity="entity6" entitytype="PERSON" gender="female" id="s14053" mentiontype="name" oid="named322" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">Harriet</mention>.  <quote connection="s14053" id="s16273" mention="named322" oid="100" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"Poor creatures! one can think of nothing else."</quote>

<quote connection="s14055" id="s16274" mention="named323" oid="101" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over,"</quote> said <mention connection="s16274,s16275" entity="entity3" entitytype="PERSON" gender="female" id="s14055" mentiontype="name" oid="named323" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">Emma</mention>, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep which ended the narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden, and brought them into the lane again.  <quote connection="s14055" id="s16275" mention="named323" oid="102" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"I do not think it will,"</quote> stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place, and recall the still greater within.

<quote connection="s14057" id="s16276" mention="organism146" oid="103" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"Oh! dear, no,"</quote> said <mention class="companion" connection="s16276" entity="organism146" entitytype="PERSON" gender="unknown" id="s14057" mentiontype="nominal" modifier="" oid="organism146" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">her companion</mention>.

They walked on.  The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend was passed, <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> was immediately in sight; and so near as to give <mention connection="s16277" id="s16297" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">Emma</mention> time only to say farther,

<quote connection="s16297" id="s16277" oid="104" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"Ah!  Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts.  Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers, it has done all that is truly important.  If <mention>we</mention> feel for the wretched, enough to do all <mention>we</mention> can for them, the rest is empty sympathy, only distressing to ourselves."</quote>

<mention connection="s16278" entity="entity6" entitytype="PERSON" gender="female" id="s14063" mentiontype="name" oid="named331" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">Harriet</mention> could just answer, <quote connection="s14063" id="s16278" mention="named331" oid="105" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"Oh! dear, yes,"</quote> before the gentleman joined them.  The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however, were the first subject on meeting.  He had been going to call on them.  His visit he would now defer; but they had a very interesting parley about what could be done and should be done.  <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> then turned back to accompany them.

<quote connection="s14067" id="s16279" mention="named332" oid="106" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"To fall in with each other on such an errand as this,"</quote> thought <mention connection="s16279,s16280" entity="entity3" entitytype="PERSON" gender="female" id="s14067" mentiontype="name" oid="named332" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">Emma</mention>; <quote connection="s14067" id="s16280" mention="named332" oid="107" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase of love on each side.  I should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration.  It must, if I were not here.  I wish I were anywhere else."</quote>

Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised on one side of the lane, leaving them together in the main road.  But she had not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet's habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that, in short, they would both be soon after her.  This would not do; she immediately stopped, under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half-boot, and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on, and she would follow in half a minute.  They did as they were desired; and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot, she had the comfort of farther delay in her power, being overtaken by a child from the cottage, setting out, according to orders, with her pitcher, to fetch broth from Hartfield.  To walk by the side of this child, and talk to and question her, was the most natural thing in the world, or would have been the most natural, had she been acting just then without design; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead, without any obligation of waiting for her.  She gained on them, however, involuntarily:  the child's pace was quick, and theirs rather slow; and she was the more concerned at it, from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them.  <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> was speaking with animation, <mention>Harriet</mention> listening with a very pleased attention; and <mention>Emma</mention>, having sent the child on, was beginning to think how she might draw back a little more, when they both looked around, and she was obliged to join them.

<mention>Mr. Elton</mention> was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail; and <mention connection="s16281,s16282" id="s16299" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">Emma</mention> experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday's party at his friend Cole's, and that she was come in herself for the Stilton cheese, the north Wiltshire, the butter, the cellery, the beet-root, and all the dessert.

<quote connection="s16299" id="s16281" mention="named344" oid="108" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"This would soon have led to something better, of course,"</quote> was her consoling reflection; <quote connection="s16299" id="s16282" mention="named344" oid="109" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"any thing interests between those who love; and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart.  If I could but have kept longer away!"</quote>

They now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage pales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting <mention>Harriet</mention> into the house, made her again find something very much amiss about her boot, and fall behind to arrange it once more.  She then broke the lace off short, and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently obliged to entreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.

<quote connection="s16298" id="s16283" mention="named344" oid="110" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"Part of my lace is gone,"</quote> said <mention connection="s16284,s16283" id="s16298" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">she</mention>, <quote connection="s16298" id="s16284" mention="named346" oid="111" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"and I do not know how I am to contrive.  I really am a most troublesome companion to you both, but I hope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg leave to stop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string, or any thing just to keep my boot on."</quote>

Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage.  The room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied, and looking forwards; behind it was another with which it immediately communicated; the door between them was open, and <mention>Emma</mention> passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner. She was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it; but she fully intended that <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> should close it.  It was not closed, however, it still remained ajar; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room.  For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself.  It could be protracted no longer.  She was then obliged to be finished, and make her appearance.

The lovers were standing together at one of the windows.  It had a most favourable aspect; and, for half a minute, <mention>Emma</mention> felt the glory of having schemed successfully.  But it would not do; he had not come to the point.  He had been most agreeable, most delightful; he had told <mention>Harriet</mention> that he had seen them go by, and had purposely followed them; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt, but nothing serious.

<quote connection="s14109" id="s16285" mention="named359" oid="112" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"Cautious, very cautious,"</quote> thought <mention connection="s16285,s16286" entity="entity3" entitytype="PERSON" gender="female" id="s14109" mentiontype="name" oid="named359" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">Emma</mention>; <quote connection="s14109" id="s16286" mention="named359" oid="113" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"he advances inch by inch, and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure."</quote>

Still, however, though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device, she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both, and must be leading them forward to the great event.</chapter><chapter>CHAPTER XI

<mention>Mr. Elton</mention> must now be left to himself.  It was no longer in Emma's power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures.  The coming of her sister's family was so very near at hand, that first in anticipation, and then in reality, it became henceforth her prime object of interest; and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be expected-- she did not herself expect-- that any thing beyond occasional, fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers.  They might advance rapidly if they would, however; they must advance somehow or other whether they would or no.  She hardly wished to have more leisure for them.  There are people, who the more you do for them, the less they will do for themselves.

Mr. and <mention>Mrs. John Knightley</mention>, from having been longer than usual absent from Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest.  Till this year, every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey; but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea-bathing for the children, and it was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their Surry connexions, or seen at all by <mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention>, who could not be induced to get so far as London, even for poor Isabella's sake; and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit.

He thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way; but his alarms were needless; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished, and Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, their five children, and a competent number of nursery-maids, all reaching Hartfield in safety.  The bustle and joy of such an arrival, the many to be talked to, welcomed, encouraged, and variously dispersed and disposed of, produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause, nor have endured much longer even for this; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by <mention>Mrs. John Knightley</mention>, that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones, and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance, all the eating and drinking, and sleeping and playing, which they could possibly wish for, without the smallest delay, the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him, either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them.

<mention>Mrs. John Knightley</mention> was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle, quiet manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate; wrapt up in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother, and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that, but for these higher ties, a warmer love might have seemed impossible.  She could never see a fault in any of them.  She was not <mention>a woman</mention> of strong understanding or any quickness; and with this resemblance of her father, she inherited also much of his constitution; was delicate in her own health, over-careful of that of her children, had many fears and many nerves, and was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield in town as her father could be of <mention>Mr. Perry</mention>.  They were alike too, in a general benevolence of temper, and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance.

<mention>Mr. John Knightley</mention> was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man; rising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his private character; but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour.  He was not an ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach; but his temper was not his great perfection; and, indeed, with such a worshipping wife, it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased.  The extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his.  He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted, and he could sometimes act an ungracious, or say a severe thing.

He was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law. Nothing wrong in him escaped her.  She was quick in feeling the little injuries to <mention>Isabella</mention>, which <mention>Isabella</mention> never felt herself.  Perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella's sister, but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend, without praise and without blindness; but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into, the want of respectful forbearance towards her father.  There he had not always the patience that could have been wished.  Mr. Woodhouse's peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill-bestowed.  It did not often happen; for <mention>Mr. John Knightley</mention> had really a great regard for his father-in-law, and generally a strong sense of what was due to him; but it was too often for Emma's charity, especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured, though the offence came not. The beginning, however, of every visit displayed <mention>none</mention> but the properest feelings, and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality.

Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on <mention>Mr. Weston</mention>, and had half a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let it pass.  She would keep the peace if possible; and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits, the all-sufficiency of home to himself, whence resulted her brother's disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse, and those to whom it was important.-- It had a high claim to forbearance.</chapter><chapter>CHAPTER XII

<mention>Mr. Knightley</mention> was to dine with them-- rather against the inclination of <mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention>, who did not like that any one should share with him in Isabella's first day.  Emma's sense of right however had decided it; and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother, she had particular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late disagreement between <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention> and herself, in procuring him the proper invitation.

She hoped they might now become friends again.  She thought it was time to make up.  Making-up indeed would not do.  She certainly had not been in the wrong, and he would never own that he had.  Concession must be out of the question; but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship, that when he came into the room she had one of the children with her-- the youngest, a nice little girl about eight months old, who was now making her first visit to Hartfield, and very happy to be danced about in her aunt's arms.  It did assist; for though he began with grave looks and short questions, he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way, and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity.  <mention>Emma</mention> felt they were friends again; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction, and then a little sauciness, <mention connection="s21781" id="s21845" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">she</mention> could not help saying, as <mention connection="s21782" id="s21863" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">he</mention> was admiring the baby,

<quote connection="s21847" id="s21794" oid="158" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"Ah!-- Indeed I am very sorry.-- Come, shake hands with me."</quote>

This had just taken place and with great cordiality, when <mention connection="s21795" id="s21853" speaker="Mr_John_Knightley">John Knightley</mention> made his appearance, and <quote connection="s21853" id="s21795" mention="named497" oid="159" speaker="Mr_John_Knightley">"How d'ye do, <mention connection="s21796" id="s21883" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">George</mention>?"</quote> and <quote connection="s21883" id="s21796" mention="named497" oid="160" speaker="Mr_George_Knightley">"John, how are you?"</quote> succeeded in the true English style, burying under a calmness that seemed all but indifference, the real attachment which would have led either of them, if requisite, to do every thing for the good of the other.

The evening was quiet and conversable, as <mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention> declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella, and the little party made two natural divisions; on one side he and his daughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys; their subjects totally distinct, or very rarely mixing-- and <mention>Emma</mention> only occasionally joining in one or the other.

The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, but principally of those of the elder, whose temper was by much the most communicative, and who was always the greater talker.  As a magistrate, he had generally some point of law to consult <mention>John</mention> about, or, at least, some curious anecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand the home-farm at Donwell, he had to tell what every field was to bear next year, and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life, and whose attachments were strong.  The plan of a drain, the change of a fence, the felling of a tree, and the destination of every acre for wheat, turnips, or spring corn, was entered into with as much equality of interest by <mention>John</mention>, as his cooler manners rendered possible; and if his willing brother ever left him any thing to inquire about, his inquiries even approached a tone of eagerness.

While they were thus comfortably occupied, <mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention> was enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter.

<quote connection="s21848" id="s21797" mention="named507" oid="161" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">"My poor dear Isabella,"</quote> said <mention connection="s21797,s21798" id="s21848" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">he</mention>, fondly taking her hand, and interrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one of her five children-- <quote connection="s21848" id="s21798" mention="named507" oid="162" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">"How long it is, how terribly long since you were here!

My dear Emma, suppose <mention>we</mention> all have a little gruel."</quote>

Emma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did, that both the Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself;-- and two basins only were ordered.  After a little more discourse in praise of gruel, with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body, <mention connection="s21799" id="s21867" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">he</mention> proceeded to say, with an air of grave reflection,

This topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of similar moment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening did not close without a little return of agitation.  The gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said-- much praise and many comments-- undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution, and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerable;-- but, unfortunately, among the failures which the daughter had to instance, the most recent, and therefore most prominent, was in her own cook at South End, a young woman hired for the time, who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel, thin, but not too thin.  Often as she had wished for and ordered it, she had never been able to get any thing tolerable.  Here was a dangerous opening.

<quote connection="s21861" id="s21830" mention="named617" oid="194" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">"Ah!"</quote> said <mention connection="s21830,s21831" id="s21861" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">Mr. Woodhouse</mention>, shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her with tender concern.-- The ejaculation in Emma's ear expressed, <quote connection="s21861" id="s21831" mention="named617" oid="195" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">"Ah! there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End.

Emma's attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he had reached such a point as this, she could not wonder at her brother-in-law's breaking out.

Mr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend <mention>Perry</mention>, to whom he had, in fact, though unconsciously, been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions;-- but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil, and the immediate alertness of one brother, and better recollections of the other, prevented any renewal of it.</chapter><chapter>CHAPTER XIII

There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than <mention>Mrs. John Knightley</mention>, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children, and talking over what she had done every evening with her father and sister.  She had nothing to wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass so swiftly. It was a delightful visit;-- perfect, in being much too short.

In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out of the house too, there was no avoiding, though at Christmas.  <mention>Mr. Weston</mention> would take no denial; they must all dine at Randalls one day;-- even Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party.

How they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty if he could, but as his son and daughter's carriage and horses were actually at Hartfield, he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head; it hardly amounted to a doubt; nor did it occupy <mention>Emma</mention> long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for <mention>Harriet</mention> also.

<mention>Harriet</mention>, <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>, and <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention>, their own especial set, were the only persons invited to meet them;-- the hours were to be early, as well as the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse's habits and inclination being consulted in every thing.

The evening before this great event (for it was a very great event that <mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention> should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been spent by <mention>Harriet</mention> at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by <mention>Mrs. Goddard</mention>, <mention>Emma</mention> could not have allowed her to leave the house.  <mention>Emma</mention> called on her the next day, and found her doom already signed with regard to Randalls.  She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat: <mention>Mrs. Goddard</mention> was full of care and affection, <mention>Mr. Perry</mention> was talked of, and <mention>Harriet</mention> herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement, though she could not speak of her loss without many tears.

<mention>Emma</mention> sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in Mrs. Goddard's unavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representing how much <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>'s would be depressed when he knew her state; and left her at last tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit, and of their all missing her very much.  She had not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard's door, when she was met by <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> himself, evidently coming towards it, and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid-- of whom he, on the rumour of considerable illness, had been going to inquire, that he might carry some report of her to Hartfield-- they were overtaken by <mention>Mr. John Knightley</mention> returning from the daily visit to Donwell, with his two eldest boys, whose healthy, glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run, and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for.  They joined company and proceeded together.  <mention connection="s24688" entity="entity3" entitytype="PERSON" gender="female" id="s22902" mentiontype="name" oid="named694" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">Emma</mention> was just describing the nature of her friend's complaint;-- <quote connection="s22902" id="s24688" mention="named694" oid="208" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat about her, a quick, low pulse, &amp;c.  and she was sorry to find from <mention>Mrs. Goddard</mention> that <mention>Harriet</mention> was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often alarmed her with them."</quote> Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion, as <mention connection="s24689" id="s24732" speaker="Mr_Elton">he</mention> exclaimed,

<quote connection="s24732" id="s24689" mention="named690" oid="209" speaker="Mr_Elton">"A sore-throat! -- I hope not infectious.  I hope not of a putrid infectious sort.  Has Perry seen her?  Indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend.  Let me entreat you to run no risks.  Why does not Perry see her?"</quote>

Emma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard's experience and care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away, which she would rather feed and assist than not, <mention connection="s24690" id="s24733" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">she</mention> added soon afterwards-- as if quite another subject,

<quote connection="s24733" id="s24690" mention="named700" oid="210" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"It is so cold, so very cold-- and looks and feels so very much like snow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, I should really try not to go out to-day-- and dissuade my father from venturing; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem to feel the cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it would be so great a disappointment to Mr. and <mention>Mrs. Weston</mention>.  But, upon my word, <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>, in your case, I should certainly excuse myself.  You appear to me a little hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to-morrow will bring, I think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night."</quote>

Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make; which was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of her's, he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;-- but <mention>Emma</mention>, too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially, or see him with clear vision, was very well satisfied with <mention connection="s24691" id="s24746" speaker="Mr_Elton">his</mention> muttering acknowledgment of its being <quote connection="s24746" id="s24691" mention="named708" oid="211" speaker="Mr_Elton">"very cold, certainly very cold,"</quote> and walked on, rejoicing in having extricated him from Randalls, and secured him the power of sending to inquire after <mention>Harriet</mention> every hour of the evening.

<quote connection="s24734" id="s24692" mention="named711" oid="212" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"You do quite right,"</quote> said <mention connection="s24692,s24693" id="s24734" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">she</mention>;-- <quote connection="s24734" id="s24693" mention="named711" oid="213" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"<mention>we</mention> will make your apologies to Mr. and <mention>Mrs. Weston</mention>."</quote>

But hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton's only objection, and <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction.  It was a done thing; <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> was to go, and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment; never had his smile been stronger, nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her.

<quote connection="s24735" id="s24694" mention="named711" oid="214" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"Well,"</quote> said <mention connection="s24694,s24695" id="s24735" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">she</mention> to herself, <quote connection="s24735" id="s24695" mention="named711" oid="215" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"this is most strange!-- After I had got him off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave <mention>Harriet</mention> ill behind!-- Most strange indeed!-- But there is, I believe, in many men, especially single men, such an inclination-- such a passion for dining out -- a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures, their employments, their dignities, almost their duties, that any thing gives way to it-- and this must be the case with <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>; a most valuable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly, and very much in love with <mention>Harriet</mention>; but still, he cannot refuse an invitation, he must dine out wherever he is asked.  What a strange thing love is! he can see ready wit in <mention>Harriet</mention>, but will not dine alone for her."</quote>

Soon afterwards <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> quitted them, and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of naming <mention>Harriet</mention> at parting; in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he should call at <mention>Mrs. Goddard</mention>'s for news of her fair friend, the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again, when he hoped to be able to give a better report; and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour.

After a few minutes of entire silence between them, <mention connection="s24696" entity="entity2" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s22949" mentiontype="name" oid="named725" speaker="Mr_John_Knightley">John Knightley</mention> began with--

He said no more.

<mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention> had so completely made up his mind to the visit, that in spite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others; too full of the wonder of his own going, and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it was cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it.  The cold, however, was severe; and by the time the second carriage was in motion, a few flakes of snow were finding their way down, and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time.

<mention>Emma</mention> soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour.  The preparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice of his children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least, which <mention>Mr. John Knightley</mention> did not by any means like; he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent.

<quote connection="s24740" id="s24707" mention="named746" oid="227" speaker="Mr_John_Knightley">"A man,"</quote> said <mention connection="s24707,s24708" id="s24740" speaker="Mr_John_Knightley">he</mention>, <quote connection="s24740" id="s24708" mention="named746" oid="228" speaker="Mr_John_Knightley">"must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such a day as this, for the sake of coming to see him.

Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the <quote connection="s24749" id="s24709" oid="229" speaker="his_travelling_companion">"Very true, my love,"</quote> which must have been usually administered by <mention connection="s24709" id="s24749" speaker="his_travelling_companion">his travelling companion</mention>; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all.  She could not be complying, she dreaded being quarrelsome; her heroism reached only to silence.  She allowed him to talk, and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without opening her lips.

They arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down, and <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>, spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly.  <mention>Emma</mention> thought with pleasure of some change of subject.  <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> was all obligation and cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed, that she began to think he must have received a different account of <mention>Harriet</mention> from what had reached her.  She had sent while dressing, and the answer had been, <quote connection="s24750" id="s24751" speaker="Mrs_Goddard">"Much the same-- not better."</quote>

<quote connection="s24742" id="s24711" mention="named753" oid="231" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"My report from <mention connection="s24751,s24752" id="s24750" speaker="Mrs_Goddard">Mrs. Goddard's</mention>,"</quote> said <mention connection="s24711,s24712" id="s24742" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">she</mention> presently, <quote connection="s24742" id="s24712" mention="named753" oid="232" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"was not so pleasant as I had hoped-- <quote connection="s24750" id="s24752" speaker="Mrs_Goddard">'Not better' </quote>was my answer."</quote>

His face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice of sentiment as <mention connection="s24714,s24716,s24718" id="s24741" speaker="Mr_Elton">he</mention> answered.

<quote connection="s24741" id="s24714" mention="named751" oid="233" speaker="Mr_Elton">"Oh! no -- I am grieved to find -- I was on the point of telling you that when I called at Mrs. Goddard's door, which I did the very last thing before I returned to dress, I was told that <mention>Miss Smith</mention> was not better, by no means better, rather worse.

This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable; but it should have lasted longer.  <mention>Emma</mention> was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things, and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.

At another time <mention>Emma</mention> might have been amused, but she was too much astonished now at Mr. Elton's spirits for other feelings.  <mention>Harriet</mention> seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.

Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into Mrs. Weston's drawing-room;-- Mr. Elton must compose his joyous looks, and <mention>Mr. John Knightley</mention> disperse his ill-humour. <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> must smile less, and <mention>Mr. John Knightley</mention> more, to fit them for the place.-- Emma only might be as nature prompted, and shew herself just as happy as she was.  To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons. <mention>Mr. Weston</mention> was a great favourite, and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve, as to his wife; not any one, to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood, of being always interesting and always intelligible, the little affairs, arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her father and herself.  She could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which <mention>Mrs. Weston</mention> had not a lively concern; and half an hour's uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends, was one of the first gratifications of each.

This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day's visit might not afford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; but the very sight of <mention>Mrs. Weston</mention>, her smile, her touch, her voice was grateful to <mention>Emma</mention>, and she determined to think as little as possible of Mr. Elton's oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant, and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost.

The misfortune of Harriet's cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival.  <mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention> had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it, besides all the history of his own and <mention>Isabella</mention>'s coming, and of Emma's being to follow, and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that <mention>James</mention> should come and see his daughter, when the others appeared, and <mention>Mrs. Weston</mention>, who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him, was able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma.

Emma's project of forgetting <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> for a while made her rather sorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was close to her.  The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards <mention>Harriet</mention>, from her mind, while he not only sat at her elbow, but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice, and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion.  Instead of forgetting him, his behaviour was such that <mention connection="s27600" id="s27630" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">she</mention> could not avoid the internal suggestion of <quote connection="s27630" id="s27600" mention="named832" oid="251" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"Can it really be as my brother imagined? can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from <mention>Harriet</mention> to me?-- Absurd and insufferable!"</quote>-- Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm, would be so interested about her father, and so delighted with <mention>Mrs. Weston</mention>; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would-be lover, and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners.  For her own sake she could not be rude; and for <mention>Harriet</mention>'s, in the hope that all would yet turn out right, she was even positively civil; but it was an effort; especially as something was going on amongst the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton's nonsense, which she particularly wished to listen to.  She heard enough to know that <mention connection="s27603,s27602,s27632" id="s27631" speaker="Mr_Weston">Mr. Weston</mention> was giving some information about his son; she heard the words <quote connection="s27631" id="s27632" speaker="Mr_Weston">"my son,"</quote> and <quote connection="s27631" id="s27602" oid="253" speaker="Mr_Weston">"Frank,"</quote> and <quote connection="s27631" id="s27603" oid="254" speaker="Mr_Weston">"my son,"</quote> repeated several times over; and, from a few other half-syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son; but before she could quiet <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>, the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward.

Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma's resolution of never marrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of <mention>Mr. Frank Churchill</mention>, which always interested her.  She had frequently thought-- especially since his father's marriage with Miss Taylor-- that if she were to marry, he was the very person to suit her in age, character and condition.  He seemed by this connexion between the families, quite to belong to her.  She could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of.  That Mr. and <mention>Mrs. Weston</mention> did think of it, she was very strongly persuaded; and though not meaning to be induced by him, or by any body else, to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for, she had a great curiosity to see him, a decided intention of finding him pleasant, of being liked by him to a certain degree, and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends' imaginations.

With such sensations, Mr. Elton's civilities were dreadfully ill-timed; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling very cross-- and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again, or the substance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.-- So it proved;-- for when happily released from <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>, and seated by <mention>Mr. Weston</mention>, at dinner, <mention connection="s27604" id="s27633" speaker="Mr_Weston">he</mention> made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton, to say to her,

<quote connection="s27633" id="s27604" mention="named838" oid="255" speaker="Mr_Weston">"We want only two more to be just the right number.  I should like to see two more here,-- your pretty little friend, <mention>Miss Smith</mention>, and my son-- and then I should say <mention>we</mention> were quite complete.  I believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing-room that <mention>we</mention> are expecting <mention>Frank</mention>.  I had a letter from him this morning, and he will be with us within a fortnight."</quote>

There are secrets in all families, you know)-- The case is, that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January; and that Frank's coming depends upon their being put off.  If they are not put off, he cannot stir.  But I know they will, because it is a family that a certain lady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, has a particular dislike to: and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or three years, they always are put off when it comes to the point.  I have not the smallest doubt of the issue.  I am as confident of seeing <mention>Frank</mention> here before the middle of January, as I am of being here myself:  but your good friend there (nodding towards the upper end of the table) has so few vagaries herself, and has been so little used to them at Hartfield, that she cannot calculate on their effects, as I have been long in the practice of doing."</quote>

I used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body, except herself:  but she has always been kind to him (in her way-- allowing for little whims and caprices, and expecting every thing to be as she likes). And it is no small credit, in my opinion, to him, that he should excite such an affection; for, though I would not say it to any body else, she has no more heart than a stone to people in general; and the devil of a temper."</quote>

Emma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to <mention>Mrs. Weston</mention>, very soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her joy-- yet observing, that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.-- <mention connection="s27612" id="s27636" speaker="Miss_Taylor">Mrs. Weston</mention> agreed to it; but added, that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of:  <quote connection="s27636" id="s27612" mention="named879" oid="263" speaker="Miss_Taylor">"for I cannot depend upon his coming.

What a blessing, that she never had any children!  Poor little creatures, how unhappy she would have made them!"</quote>

Emma wished she had been alone with <mention>Mrs. Weston</mention>.  She should then have heard more:  <mention>Mrs. Weston</mention> would speak to her, with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with <mention>Isabella</mention>; and, she really believed, would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills from her, excepting those views on the young man, of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge.  But at present there was nothing more to be said.  <mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention> very soon followed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting long after dinner, was a confinement that he could not endure.  Neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him; and gladly did he move to those with whom he was always comfortable.

While he talked to <mention>Isabella</mention>, however, <mention connection="s27619" entity="entity3" entitytype="PERSON" gender="female" id="s26068" mentiontype="name" oid="named909" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">Emma</mention> found an opportunity of saying,

Even if this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us.  I cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side; but I am sure there is a great wish on the Churchills' to keep him to themselves.  There is jealousy.  They are jealous even of his regard for his father.  In short, I can feel no dependence on his coming, and I wish <mention>Mr. Weston</mention> were less sanguine."</quote>

<quote connection="s27637" id="s27621" mention="named918" oid="272" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"He ought to come,"</quote> said <mention connection="s27621,s27622" id="s27637" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">Emma</mention>.  <quote connection="s27637" id="s27622" mention="named918" oid="273" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"If he could stay only a couple of days, he ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man's not having it in his power to do as much as that.

<mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention> was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his three companions could do, to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour, before the other gentlemen appeared.  <mention>Mr. Weston</mention> was chatty and convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort; but at last the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation.  <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>, in very good spirits, was one of the first to walk in.  <mention>Mrs. Weston</mention> and <mention>Emma</mention> were sitting together on a sofa.  He joined them immediately, and, with scarcely an invitation, seated himself between them.

Emma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of <mention>Mr. Frank Churchill</mention>, was willing to forget his late improprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before, and on his making <mention>Harriet</mention> his very first subject, was ready to listen with most friendly smiles.

<mention connection="s30511" id="s30551" speaker="Mr_Elton">He</mention> professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend-- her fair, lovely, amiable friend.  <quote connection="s30551" id="s30511" mention="named934" oid="281" speaker="Mr_Elton">"Did she know?-- had she heard any thing about her, since their being at Randalls?-- he felt much anxiety-- he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably."</quote> And in this style he talked on for some time very properly, not much attending to any answer, but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat; and <mention>Emma</mention> was quite in charity with him.

But at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account, than on Harriet's-- more anxious that she should escape the infection, than that there should be no infection in the complaint.  He began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick-chamber again, for the present-- to entreat her to promise him not to venture into such hazard till he had seen <mention>Mr. Perry</mention> and learnt his opinion; and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course, there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her.  She was vexed.  It did appear-- there was no concealing it-- exactly like the pretence of being in love with her, instead of <mention>Harriet</mention>; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible and abominable! and she had difficulty in behaving with temper.  <mention connection="s30512" id="s30550" speaker="Mr_Elton">He</mention> turned to <mention>Mrs. Weston</mention> to implore her assistance, <quote connection="s30550" id="s30512" oid="282" speaker="Mr_Elton">"Would not she give him her support?-- would not she add her persuasions to his, to induce <mention>Miss Woodhouse</mention> not to go to <mention>Mrs. Goddard</mention>'s till it were certain that Miss Smith's disorder had no infection?  He could not be satisfied without a promise-- would not she give him her influence in procuring it?"</quote>

<quote connection="s30552" id="s30513" mention="named943" oid="283" speaker="Mr_Elton">"So scrupulous for others,"</quote> <mention connection="s30513,s30514" id="s30552" speaker="Mr_Elton">he</mention> continued, <quote connection="s30552" id="s30514" mention="named943" oid="284" speaker="Mr_Elton">"and yet so careless for herself!  She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day, and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself.  Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?-- Judge between us.  Have not I some right to complain?  I am sure of your kind support and aid."</quote>

Emma saw Mrs. Weston's surprize, and felt that it must be great, at an address which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her; and as for herself, she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose.  She could only give him a look; but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses, and then left the sofa, removing to a seat by her sister, and giving her all her attention.

She had not time to know how <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> took the reproof, so rapidly did another subject succeed; for <mention connection="s30515" entity="entity2" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s29017" mentiontype="name" oid="named952" speaker="Mr_John_Knightley">Mr. John Knightley</mention> now came into the room from examining the weather, and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow, and of its still snowing fast, with a strong drifting wind; concluding with these words to <mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention>:

<quote connection="s29017" id="s30515" mention="named952" oid="285" speaker="Mr_John_Knightley">"This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements, sir. Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow."</quote>

Poor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body else had something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized, and had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer.  <mention>Mrs. Weston</mention> and <mention>Emma</mention> tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his son-in-law, who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly.

<quote connection="s30540" id="s30516" mention="named955" oid="286" speaker="Mr_John_Knightley">"I admired your resolution very much, sir,"</quote> said <mention connection="s30517,s30516" id="s30540" speaker="Mr_John_Knightley">he</mention>, <quote connection="s30540" id="s30517" mention="organism426" oid="287" speaker="Mr_John_Knightley">"in venturing out in such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow very soon. Every body must have seen the snow coming on.  I admired your spirit; and I dare say <mention>we</mention> shall get home very well.  Another hour or two's snow can hardly make the road impassable; and <mention>we</mention> are two carriages; if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand.  I dare say <mention>we</mention> shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight."</quote>

Mr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lest it should make <mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention> uncomfortable, and be an excuse for his hurrying away.  As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke; he was afraid they would find no difficulty.  He wished the road might be impassable, that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls; and with the utmost good-will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body, calling on his wife to agree with him, that with a little contrivance, every body might be lodged, which she hardly knew how to do, from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house.

<quote connection="s30542" id="s30518" mention="named966" oid="288" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">"What is to be done, my dear Emma?-- what is to be done?"</quote> was <mention connection="s30518" id="s30542" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">Mr. Woodhouse</mention>'s first exclamation, and all that he could say for some time. To her he looked for comfort; and her assurances of safety, her representation of the excellence of the horses, and of <mention>James</mention>, and of their having so many friends about them, revived him a little.

His eldest daughter's alarm was equal to his own.  The horror of being blocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield, was full in her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay, she was eager to have it settled, that her father and <mention>Emma</mention> should remain at Randalls, while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them.

<quote connection="s30541" id="s30519" mention="organism432" oid="289" speaker="Isabella_Woodhouse">"You had better order the carriage directly, my love,"</quote> said <mention connection="s30519,s30520" id="s30541" speaker="Isabella_Woodhouse">she</mention>; <quote connection="s30541" id="s30520" oid="290" speaker="Isabella_Woodhouse">"I dare say <mention>we</mention> shall be able to get along, if <mention>we</mention> set off directly; and if <mention>we</mention> do come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk.  I am not at all afraid.  I should not mind walking half the way.  I could change my shoes, you know, the moment I got home; and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold."</quote>

<quote connection="s30543" id="s30521" oid="291" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">"Indeed!"</quote> replied <mention connection="s30521,s30522" id="s30543" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">he</mention>.  <quote connection="s30543" id="s30522" mention="named966" oid="292" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">"Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thing does give you cold.  Walk home!-- you are prettily shod for walking home, I dare say.  It will be bad enough for the horses."</quote>

Isabella turned to <mention>Mrs. Weston</mention> for her approbation of the plan.  <mention>Mrs. Weston</mention> could only approve.  <mention>Isabella</mention> then went to <mention>Emma</mention>; but <mention>Emma</mention> could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away; and they were still discussing the point, when <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention>, who had left the room immediately after his brother's first report of the snow, came back again, and told them that he had been out of doors to examine, and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home, whenever they liked it, either now or an hour hence.  He had gone beyond the sweep-- some way along the Highbury road-- the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep-- in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground; a very few flakes were falling at present, but the clouds were parting, and there was every appearance of its being soon over.  He had seen the coachmen, and they both agreed with him in there being nothing to apprehend.

To <mention>Isabella</mention>, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they were scarcely less acceptable to <mention>Emma</mention> on her father's account, who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at Randalls.  He was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home, but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay; and while the others were variously urging and recommending, <mention connection="s30523,s30525" entity="entity2" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s29078" mentiontype="name" oid="named989" speaker="Mr_John_Knightley">Mr. Knightley</mention> and <mention connection="s30524,s30526" entity="entity3" entitytype="PERSON" gender="female" id="s29079" mentiontype="name" oid="named993" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">Emma</mention> settled it in a few brief sentences:  thus--

<quote connection="s29078" id="s30523" mention="named989" oid="293" speaker="Mr_John_Knightley">"Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?"</quote>

<quote connection="s29079" id="s30524" mention="named993" oid="294" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"I am ready, if the others are."</quote>

<quote connection="s29078" id="s30525" mention="named989" oid="295" speaker="Mr_John_Knightley">"Shall I ring the bell?"</quote>

<quote connection="s29079" id="s30526" mention="named993" oid="296" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"Yes, do."</quote>

And the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for.  A few minutes more, and <mention>Emma</mention> hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house, to get sober and cool, and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over.

The carriage came:  and <mention connection="s30527" entity="entity18" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s29084" mentiontype="name" oid="named998" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">Mr. Woodhouse</mention>, always the first object on such occasions, was carefully attended to his own by <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention> and <mention>Mr. Weston</mention>; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen, and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for.  <quote connection="s29084" id="s30527" mention="named998" oid="297" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">"He was afraid they should have a very bad drive.  He was afraid poor Isabella would not like it.  And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind.  He did not know what they had best do.  They must keep as much together as they could;"</quote> and <mention>James</mention> was talked to, and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage.

<mention>Isabella</mention> stept in after her father; John Knightley, forgetting that he did not belong to their party, stept in after his wife very naturally; so that <mention>Emma</mention> found, on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>, that the door was to be lawfully shut on them, and that they were to have a tete-a-tete drive.  It would not have been the awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure, previous to the suspicions of this very day; she could have talked to him of <mention>Harriet</mention>, and the three-quarters of a mile would have seemed but one.  But now, she would rather it had not happened.  She believed he had been drinking too much of Mr. Weston's good wine, and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense.

To restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely had they passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she found her subject cut up-- her hand seized-- her attention demanded, and <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> actually making violent love to her:  availing himself of the precious opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already well known, hoping-- fearing-- adoring-- ready to die if she refused him; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect, and in short, very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible.  It really was so.  Without scruple-- without apology-- without much apparent diffidence, <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>, the lover of <mention>Harriet</mention>, was professing himself her lover.  She tried to stop him; but vainly; he would go on, and say it all.  Angry as she was, the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak.  She felt that half this folly must be drunkenness, and therefore could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour.  Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the playful, which she hoped would best suit his half and half state, <mention connection="s30528" id="s30544" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">she</mention> replied,

<quote connection="s30544" id="s30528" mention="named1008" oid="298" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton.  This to me! you forget yourself-- you take me for my friend-- any message to <mention>Miss Smith</mention> I shall be happy to deliver; but no more of this to me, if you please."</quote>

<quote connection="s30545" id="s30529" mention="named1010" oid="299" speaker="Mr_Elton">"Miss Smith!-- message to Miss Smith!-- What could she possibly mean!"</quote>-- And <mention connection="s30529" id="s30545" speaker="Mr_Elton">he</mention> repeated her words with such assurance of accent, such boastful pretence of amazement, that <mention connection="s30530" id="s30546" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">she</mention> could not help replying with quickness,

<quote connection="s30546" id="s30530" mention="named1008" oid="300" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can account for it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak either to me, or of <mention>Harriet</mention>, in such a manner.  Command yourself enough to say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it."</quote>

But <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits, not at all to confuse his intellects.  He perfectly knew his own meaning; and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious, and slightly touched upon his respect for <mention>Miss Smith</mention> as her friend,-- but acknowledging his wonder that <mention>Miss Smith</mention> should be mentioned at all,-- he resumed the subject of his own passion, and was very urgent for a favourable answer.

As she thought less of his inebriety, <mention connection="s30531" id="s30547" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">she</mention> thought more of his inconstancy and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness, replied,

<quote connection="s30547" id="s30531" mention="named1008" oid="301" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"It is impossible for me to doubt any longer.  You have made yourself too clear.  Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can express.  After such behaviour, as I have witnessed during the last month, to Miss Smith-- such attentions as I have been in the daily habit of observing-- to be addressing me in this manner-- this is an unsteadiness of character, indeed, which I had not supposed possible! Believe me, sir, I am far, very far, from gratified in being the object of such professions."</quote>

<quote connection="s29130" id="s30532" mention="named1038" oid="302" speaker="Mr_Elton">"Good Heaven!"</quote> cried <mention connection="s30532,s30533" entity="entity5" entitytype="PERSON" gender="male" id="s29130" mentiontype="name" oid="named1038" speaker="Mr_Elton">Mr. Elton</mention>, <quote connection="s29130" id="s30533" oid="303" speaker="Mr_Elton">"what can be the meaning of this?-- Miss Smith! -- I never thought of <mention>Miss Smith</mention> in the whole course of my existence-- never paid her any attentions, but as your friend: never cared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend.  If she has fancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her, and I am very sorry-- extremely sorry-- But, Miss Smith, indeed!-- Oh!  <mention>Miss Woodhouse</mention>! who can think of <mention>Miss Smith</mention>, when <mention>Miss Woodhouse</mention> is near!  No, upon my honour, there is no unsteadiness of character.  I have thought only of you.  I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else.  Every thing that I have said or done, for many weeks past, has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself.  You cannot really, seriously, doubt it.  No!-- (in an accent meant to be insinuating) -- I am sure you have seen and understood me."</quote>

It would be impossible to say what <mention>Emma</mention> felt, on hearing this-- which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost.  She was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton's sanguine state of mind, he tried to take her hand again, as <mention connection="s30534" id="s30548" speaker="Mr_Elton">he</mention> joyously exclaimed--

<quote connection="s30548" id="s30534" mention="named1046" oid="304" speaker="Mr_Elton">"Charming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting silence.  It confesses that you have long understood me."</quote>

<quote connection="s29146" id="s30535" mention="named1052" oid="305" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"No, sir,"</quote> cried <mention connection="s30535,s30539,s30536" entity="entity3" entitytype="PERSON" gender="female" id="s29146" mentiontype="name" oid="named1052" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">Emma</mention>, <quote connection="s29146" id="s30536" oid="306" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"it confesses no such thing.

As to myself, I am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings-- Nothing could be farther from my wishes-- your attachment to my friend Harriet-- your pursuit of her, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great pleasure, and I have been very earnestly wishing you success: but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent.  Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith?-- that you have never thought seriously of her?"</quote>

<quote connection="s30549" id="s30537" mention="named1046" oid="307" speaker="Mr_Elton">"Never, madam,"</quote> cried <mention connection="s30537,s30538" id="s30549" speaker="Mr_Elton">he</mention>, affronted in his turn:  <quote connection="s30549" id="s30538" mention="named1046" oid="308" speaker="Mr_Elton">"never, I assure you.

I wish her extremely well:  and, no doubt, there are men who might not object to-- Every body has their level:  but as for myself, I am not, I think, quite so much at a loss.  I need not so totally despair of an equal alliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!-- No, madam, my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only; and the encouragement I received -- "</quote>

<quote connection="s29146" id="s30539" mention="named1052" oid="309" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"Encouragement! -- I give you encouragement!-- Sir, you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it.  I have seen you only as the admirer of my friend.  In no other light could you have been more to me than a common acquaintance.  I am exceedingly sorry:  but it is well that the mistake ends where it does.  Had the same behaviour continued, <mention>Miss Smith</mention> might have been led into a misconception of your views; not being aware, probably, any more than myself, of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of.  But, as it is, the disappointment is single, and, I trust, will not be lasting.  I have no thoughts of matrimony at present."</quote>

He was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided to invite supplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, and mutually deep mortification, they had to continue together a few minutes longer, for the fears of <mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention> had confined them to a foot-pace. If there had not been so much anger, there would have been desperate awkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment.  Without knowing when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped, they found themselves, all at once, at the door of his house; and he was out before another syllable passed.-- Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night.  The compliment was just returned, coldly and proudly; and, under indescribable irritation of spirits, she was then conveyed to Hartfield.

There she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her father, who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage Lane-- turning a corner which he could never bear to think of-- and in strange hands -- a mere common coachman-- no James; and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well: for <mention>Mr. John Knightley</mention>, ashamed of his ill-humour, was now all kindness and attention; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father, as to seem-- if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel-- perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome; and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party, except herself.-- But her mind had never been in such perturbation; and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection.</chapter><chapter>CHAPTER XVI

The hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and <mention connection="s33454" entity="entity3" entitytype="PERSON" gender="female" id="s32107" mentiontype="name" oid="named1086" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">Emma</mention> sat down to think and be miserable.-- It was a wretched business indeed!-- Such an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for!-- Such a development of every thing most unwelcome!-- Such a blow for Harriet!-- that was the worst of all.  Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of some sort or other; but, compared with the evil to <mention>Harriet</mention>, all was light; and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken-- more in error-- more disgraced by mis-judgment, than she actually was, could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself.

<quote connection="s32107" id="s33454" mention="named1086" oid="310" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"If I had not persuaded <mention>Harriet</mention> into liking the man, I could have borne any thing.  He might have doubled his presumption to me-- but poor Harriet!"</quote>

How she could have been so deceived!-- He protested that he had never thought seriously of Harriet-- never!  She looked back as well as she could; but it was all confusion.  She had taken up the idea, she supposed, and made every thing bend to it.  His manners, however, must have been unmarked, wavering, dubious, or she could not have been so misled.

The picture!-- How eager he had been about the picture!-- and the charade!-- and an hundred other circumstances;-- how clearly they had seemed to point at <mention>Harriet</mention>.  To be sure, the charade, with its <quote connection="" id="s33455" oid="311" speaker="none">"ready wit"</quote>-- but then the <quote connection="" id="s33456" oid="312" speaker="none">"soft eyes"</quote>-- in fact it suited neither; it was a jumble without taste or truth.  Who could have seen through such thick-headed nonsense?

Certainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners to herself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way, as a mere error of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof among others that he had not always lived in the best society, that with all the gentleness of his address, true elegance was sometimes wanting; but, till this very day, she had never, for an instant, suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet's friend.

To <mention>Mr. John Knightley</mention> was she indebted for her first idea on the subject, for the first start of its possibility.  There was no denying that those brothers had penetration.  She remembered what <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention> had once said to her about <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>, the caution he had given, the conviction he had professed that <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> would never marry indiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself.  It was dreadfully mortifying; but <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> was proving himself, in many respects, the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him; proud, assuming, conceited; very full of his own claims, and little concerned about the feelings of others.

Contrary to the usual course of things, <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>'s wanting to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion.  His professions and his proposals did him no service.  She thought nothing of his attachment, and was insulted by his hopes.  He wanted to marry well, and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her, pretended to be in love; but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for.  There had been no real affection either in his language or manners.  Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she could hardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice, less allied with real love.  She need not trouble herself to pity him. He only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if <mention>Miss Woodhouse</mention> of Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not quite so easily obtained as he had fancied, he would soon try for Miss Somebody else with twenty, or with ten.

But-- that he should talk of encouragement, should consider her as aware of his views, accepting his attentions, meaning (in short), to marry him!-- should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind!-- look down upon her friend, so well understanding the gradations of rank below him, and be so blind to what rose above, as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her!-- It was most provoking.

Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind.  The very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it; but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior.  He must know that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at Hartfield, the younger branch of a very ancient family-- and that the Eltons were nobody.  The landed property of Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable, being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate, to which all the rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, from other sources, was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey itself, in every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> had first entered not two years ago, to make his way as he could, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility.-- But he had fancied her in love with him; that evidently must have been his dependence; and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head, <mention>Emma</mention> was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging, so full of courtesy and attention, as (supposing her real motive unperceived) might warrant <mention>a man</mention> of ordinary observation and delicacy, like <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>, in fancying himself a very decided favourite. If she had so misinterpreted his feelings, she had little right to wonder that he, with self-interest to blind him, should have mistaken hers.

The first error and the worst lay at her door.  It was foolish, it was wrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two people together. It was adventuring too far, assuming too much, making light of what ought to be serious, a trick of what ought to be simple.  She was quite concerned and ashamed, and resolved to do such things no more.

<quote connection="s33460" id="s33457" mention="named1112" oid="313" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"Here have I,"</quote> said <mention connection="s33457,s33458" id="s33460" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">she</mention>, <quote connection="s33460" id="s33458" mention="named1112" oid="314" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"actually talked poor Harriet into being very much attached to this man.  She might never have thought of him but for me; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope, if I had not assured her of his attachment, for she is as modest and humble as I used to think him.  Oh! that I had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young Martin.  There I was quite right.  That was well done of me; but there I should have stopped, and left the rest to time and chance.  I was introducing her into good company, and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having; I ought not to have attempted more.  But now, poor girl, her peace is cut up for some time. I have been but half a friend to her; and if she were not to feel this disappointment so very much, I am sure I have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her;-- William Coxe-- Oh! no, I could not endure <mention>William Coxe</mention> -- a pert young lawyer."</quote>

She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse, and then resumed a more serious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been, and might be, and must be.  The distressing explanation she had to make to <mention>Harriet</mention>, and all that poor Harriet would be suffering, with the awkwardness of future meetings, the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance, of subduing feelings, concealing resentment, and avoiding eclat, were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer, and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully.

To youth and natural cheerfulness like <mention>Emma</mention>'s, though under temporary gloom at night, the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits.  The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy, and of powerful operation; and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed, they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope.

<mention>Emma</mention> got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed, more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her, and to depend on getting tolerably out of it.

It was a great consolation that <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> should not be really in love with her, or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him-- that Harriet's nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive-- and that there could be no necessity for any body's knowing what had passed except the three principals, and especially for her father's being given a moment's uneasiness about it.

These were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her further service, for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present.

The weather was most favourable for her; though Christmas Day, she could not go to church.  <mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention> would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it, and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas.  The ground covered with snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw, which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise, every morning beginning in rain or snow, and every evening setting in to freeze, she was for many days a most honourable prisoner. No intercourse with <mention>Harriet</mention> possible but by note; no church for her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day; and no need to find excuses for <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>'s absenting himself.

It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home; and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other, it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house, too wise to stir out; and to hear <mention connection="s33459" id="s33461" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">him</mention> say to <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention>, whom no weather could keep entirely from them,--

<quote connection="s33461" id="s33459" oid="315" speaker="Mr_Henry_Woodhouse">"Ah!  Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton?"</quote>

These days of confinement would have been, but for her private perplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly suited her brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance to his companions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off his ill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed him during the rest of his stay at Hartfield.  He was always agreeable and obliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body.  But with all the hopes of cheerfulness, and all the present comfort of delay, there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with <mention>Harriet</mention>, as made it impossible for <mention>Emma</mention> to be ever perfectly at ease.</chapter><chapter>CHAPTER XVII

Mr. and <mention>Mrs. John Knightley</mention> were not detained long at Hartfield.  The weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move; and <mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention> having, as usual, tried to persuade his daughter to stay behind with all her children, was obliged to see the whole party set off, and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor Isabella;-- which poor Isabella, passing her life with those she doated on, full of their merits, blind to their faults, and always innocently busy, might have been a model of right feminine happiness.

The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> to <mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention>, a long, civil, ceremonious note, to say, with <mention connection="s36369" id="s36370" speaker="Mr_Elton">Mr. Elton</mention>'s best compliments, <quote connection="s36370" id="s36369" oid="316" speaker="Mr_Elton">"that he was proposing to leave Highbury the following morning in his way to Bath; where, in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends, he had engaged to spend a few weeks, and very much regretted the impossibility he was under, from various circumstances of weather and business, of taking a personal leave of <mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention>, of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense-- and had <mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention> any commands, should be happy to attend to them."</quote>

Emma was most agreeably surprized.-- Mr. Elton's absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired.  She admired him for contriving it, though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced.  Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father, from which she was so pointedly excluded. She had not even a share in his opening compliments.-- Her name was not mentioned;-- and there was so striking a change in all this, and such an ill-judged solemnity of leave-taking in his graceful acknowledgments, as she thought, at first, could not escape her father's suspicion.

It did, however.-- Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey, and his fears that <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> might never get safely to the end of it, and saw nothing extraordinary in his language.  It was a very useful note, for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening.  <mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention> talked over his alarms, and <mention>Emma</mention> was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude.

She now resolved to keep <mention>Harriet</mention> no longer in the dark.  She had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold, and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentleman's return.  She went to <mention>Mrs. Goddard</mention>'s accordingly the very next day, to undergo the necessary penance of communication; and a severe one it was.-- She had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding-- to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred-- and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis-judging in all her ideas on one subject, all her observations, all her convictions, all her prophecies for the last six weeks.

The confession completely renewed her first shame-- and the sight of Harriet's tears made her think that she should never be in charity with herself again.

<mention>Harriet</mention> bore the intelligence very well-- blaming nobody-- and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself, as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend.

<mention>Emma</mention> was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost; and all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching, seemed on Harriet's side, not her own.  <mention>Harriet</mention> did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of.  The affection of such a man as <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> would have been too great a distinction.-- She never could have deserved him-- and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as <mention>Miss Woodhouse</mention> would have thought it possible.

Her tears fell abundantly-- but her grief was so truly artless, that no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma's eyes-- and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding-- really for the time convinced that <mention>Harriet</mention> was the superior creature of the two-- and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do.

It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-minded and ignorant; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet, and repressing imagination all the rest of her life.  Her second duty now, inferior only to her father's claims, was to promote Harriet's comfort, and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by match-making.  She got her to Hartfield, and shewed her the most unvarying kindness, striving to occupy and amuse her, and by books and conversation, to drive <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> from her thoughts.

Time, she knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done; and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general, and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> in particular; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet's age, and with the entire extinction of all hope, such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton's return, as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance, without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them.

<mention>Harriet</mention> did think him all perfection, and maintained the non-existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness-- and did, in truth, prove herself more resolutely in love than <mention>Emma</mention> had foreseen; but yet it appeared to her so natural, so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort unrequited, that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force.

If <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>, on his return, made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do, she could not imagine Harriet's persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him.

Their being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was bad for each, for all three.  Not one of them had the power of removal, or of effecting any material change of society.  They must encounter each other, and make the best of it.

<mention>Harriet</mention> was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at <mention>Mrs. Goddard</mention>'s; <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth.  Where the wound had been given, there must the cure be found if anywhere; and <mention>Emma</mention> felt that, till she saw her in the way of cure, there could be no true peace for herself.</chapter><chapter>CHAPTER XVIII

<mention>Mr. Frank Churchill</mention> did not come.  When the time proposed drew near, Mrs. Weston's fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse.  For the present, he could not be spared, to <mention connection="s39279" id="s39319" speaker="Mr_Frank_Churchill">his</mention> <quote connection="s39319" id="s39279" oid="317" speaker="Mr_Frank_Churchill">"very great mortification and regret; but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to Randalls at no distant period."</quote>

Mrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed-- much more disappointed, in fact, than her husband, though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober:  but a sanguine temper, though for ever expecting more good than occurs, does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression.  It soon flies over the present failure, and begins to hope again.  For half an hour <mention>Mr. Weston</mention> was surprized and sorry; but then he began to perceive that <mention>Frank</mention>'s coming two or three months later would be a much better plan; better time of year; better weather; and that he would be able, without any doubt, to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner.

These feelings rapidly restored his comfort, while <mention>Mrs. Weston</mention>, of a more apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays; and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer, suffered a great deal more herself.

<mention>Emma</mention> was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about <mention>Mr. Frank Churchill</mention>'s not coming, except as a disappointment at Randalls.  The acquaintance at present had no charm for her.  She wanted, rather, to be quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it was desirable that she should appear, in general, like her usual self, she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance, and enter as warmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston's disappointment, as might naturally belong to their friendship.

She was the first to announce it to <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention>; and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps rather more,) at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him away.  She then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in Surry; the pleasure of looking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire, which the sight of him would have made; and ending with reflections on the Churchills again, found herself directly involved in a disagreement with <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention>; and, to her great amusement, perceived that <mention connection="s39282,s39284,s39286" id="s39330" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">she</mention> was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion, and making use of Mrs. Weston's arguments against herself.

<quote connection="s39330" id="s39284" mention="named1201" oid="322" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"How odd you are!  What has <mention>Mr. Frank Churchill</mention> done, to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature?"</quote>

If <mention>Frank Churchill</mention> had wanted to see his father, he would have contrived it between September and January.  A man at his age-- what is he?-- three or four-and-twenty-- cannot be without the means of doing as much as that.  It is impossible."</quote>

We hear of him for ever at some watering-place or other.  A little while ago, he was at Weymouth.  This proves that he can leave the Churchills."</quote>

Respect would be added to affection.  They would feel that they could trust him; that the nephew who had done rightly by his father, would do rightly by them; for they know, as well as he does, as well as all the world must know, that he ought to pay this visit to his father; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it, are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims.

To him who has, it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence, and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought.  He may have as strong a sense of what would be right, as you can have, without being so equal, under particular circumstances, to act up to it."</quote>

It ought to have been a habit with him by this time, of following his duty, instead of consulting expediency.  I can allow for the fears of the child, but not of the man.  As he became rational, he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority.

CHAPTER I

<mention>Emma</mention> and <mention>Harriet</mention> had been walking together one morning, and, in Emma's opinion, had been talking enough of <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> for that day.  She could not think that <mention connection="s42281" entity="entity6" entitytype="PERSON" gender="female" id="s41189" mentiontype="name" oid="named1274" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">Harriet</mention>'s solace or her own sins required more; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned;-- but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded, and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter, and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive-- <quote connection="s41189" id="s42281" mention="named1274" oid="355" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"<mention>Mr. Elton</mention> is so good to the poor!"</quote> she found something else must be done.

They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and <mention>Miss Bates</mention>. She determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers.  There was always sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and <mention>Miss Bates</mention> loved to be called on, and she knew she was considered by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her, as rather negligent in that respect, and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts.

She had had many a hint from <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention> and some from her own heart, as to her deficiency-- but <mention>none</mention> were equal to counteract the persuasion of its being very disagreeable, -- a waste of time-- tiresome women-- and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate and third-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them for ever, and therefore she seldom went near them.  But now she made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going in-- observing, as she proposed it to <mention>Harriet</mention>, that, as well as she could calculate, they were just now quite safe from any letter from <mention>Jane Fairfax</mention>.

The house belonged to people in business.  Mrs. and <mention>Miss Bates</mention> occupied the drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sized apartment, which was every thing to them, the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner, wanting even to give up her place to <mention>Miss Woodhouse</mention>, and her more active, <mention connection="s42282" id="s42325" speaker="Miss_Jane_Bates">talking daughter</mention>, almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness, thanks for their visit, solicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries after Mr. Woodhouse's health, cheerful communications about her mother's, and sweet-cake from the beaufet-- <quote connection="s42325" id="s42282" oid="356" speaker="Miss_Jane_Bates">"<mention>Mrs. Cole</mention> had just been there, just called in for ten minutes, and had been so good as to sit an hour with them, and she had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much; and, therefore, she hoped <mention>Miss Woodhouse</mention> and <mention>Miss Smith</mention> would do them the favour to eat a piece too."</quote>

The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>. There was intimacy between them, and <mention>Mr. Cole</mention> had heard from <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> since his going away.  <mention>Emma</mention> knew what was coming; they must have the letter over again, and settle how long he had been gone, and how much he was engaged in company, and what a favourite he was wherever he went, and how full the Master of the Ceremonies' ball had been; and she went through it very well, with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite, and always putting forward to prevent <mention>Harriet</mention>'s being obliged to say a word.

This she had been prepared for when she entered the house; but meant, having once talked him handsomely over, to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic, and to wander at large amongst all the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury, and their card-parties.  She had not been prepared to have <mention>Jane Fairfax</mention> succeed <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>; but he was actually hurried off by <mention>Miss Bates</mention>, <mention connection="s42283" id="s42316" speaker="Miss_Jane_Bates">she</mention> jumped away from him at last abruptly to the Coles, to usher in a letter from her niece.

<quote connection="s42316" id="s42283" mention="named1294" oid="357" speaker="Miss_Jane_Bates">"Oh! yes-- <mention>Mr. Elton</mention>, I understand-- certainly as to dancing-- Mrs. Cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was-- <mention>Mrs. Cole</mention> was so kind as to sit some time with us, talking of <mention>Jane</mention>; for as soon as she came in, she began inquiring after her, <mention>Jane</mention> is so very great a favourite there.  Whenever she is with us, <mention>Mrs. Cole</mention> does not know how to shew her kindness enough; and I must say that <mention>Jane</mention> deserves it as much as any body can.  And so <mention connection="s42284" id="s42320" speaker="Mrs_Cole">she</mention> began inquiring after her directly, saying, <quote connection="s42320" id="s42284" oid="" speaker="Mrs_Cole">'I know you cannot have heard from <mention>Jane</mention> lately, because it is not her time for writing;'</quote> and when <mention connection="s42285" id="s42321" speaker="Miss_Jane_Bates">I</mention> immediately said, <quote connection="s42321" id="s42285" oid="" speaker="Miss_Jane_Bates">'But indeed <mention>we</mention> have, <mention>we</mention> had a letter this very morning,'</quote> I do not know that I ever saw any body more surprized.  <quote connection="s42322" id="s42286" oid="" speaker="Mrs_Cole">'Have you, upon your honour?'</quote> said <mention connection="s42286,s42287" id="s42322" speaker="Mrs_Cole">she</mention>; <quote connection="s42322" id="s42287" oid="" speaker="Mrs_Cole">'well, that is quite unexpected.

I was sure it could not be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see, without being aware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand so very lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table.  I was reading it to <mention>Mrs. Cole</mention>, and since she went away, I was reading it again to my mother, for it is such a pleasure to her -- a letter from Jane-- that she can never hear it often enough; so I knew it could not be far off, and here it is, only just under my huswife-- and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says;-- but, first of all, I really must, in justice to <mention>Jane</mention>, apologise for her writing so short a letter-- only two pages you see-- hardly two-- and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half.  My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well.  <mention connection="s42291" id="s42318" speaker="Mrs_Bates">She</mention> often says, when the letter is first opened, <quote connection="s42318" id="s42291" oid="" speaker="Mrs_Bates">'Well, Hetty, now I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work'</quote>-- don't you, ma'am?-- And then I tell her, I am sure she would contrive to make it out herself, if she had nobody to do it for her-- every word of it -- I am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word. And, indeed, though my mother's eyes are not so good as they were, she can see amazingly well still, thank God!  with the help of spectacles. It is such a blessing!  My mother's are really very good indeed.  <mention connection="s42292" id="s42317" speaker="Miss_Jane_Fairfax">Jane</mention> often says, when she is here, <quote connection="s42317" id="s42292" oid="" speaker="Miss_Jane_Fairfax">'I am sure, grandmama, you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do-- and so much fine work as you have done too! -- I only wish my eyes may last me as well.'</quote>"</quote>

All this spoken extremely fast obliged <mention>Miss Bates</mention> to stop for breath; and <mention>Emma</mention> said something very civil about the excellence of Miss Fairfax's handwriting.

<quote connection="s41272" id="s42293" mention="named1344" oid="361" speaker="Miss_Jane_Bates">"You are extremely kind,"</quote> replied <mention connection="s42293,s42294,s42295" entity="entity155" entitytype="PERSON" gender="female" id="s41272" mentiontype="name" oid="named1344" speaker="Miss_Jane_Bates">Miss Bates</mention>, highly gratified; <quote connection="s41272" id="s42294" mention="named1344" oid="362" speaker="Miss_Jane_Bates">"you who are such a judge, and write so beautifully yourself.

She was pondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seeming very rude, of making her escape from Jane Fairfax's letter, and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse, when <mention connection="s42296,s42298,s42300,s42302,s42312,s42310,s42308,s42306,s42304" entity="entity155" entitytype="PERSON" gender="female" id="s41283" mentiontype="name" oid="named1348" speaker="Miss_Jane_Bates">Miss Bates</mention> turned to her again and seized her attention.

However, she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago; which is saying a great deal at my mother's time of life-- and it really is full two years, you know, since she was here.

<quote connection="s41279" id="s42299" mention="named1348" oid="367" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"Indeed!-- that must be a very great pleasure."</quote>

Every body is so surprized; and every body says the same obliging things.  I am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at Highbury, as they can be to see her.  Yes, Friday or Saturday; she cannot say which, because Colonel Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days.  So very good of them to send her the whole way!  But they always do, you know.  Oh yes, Friday or Saturday next.  That is what she writes about. That is the reason of her writing out of rule, as <mention>we</mention> call it; for, in the common course, <mention>we</mention> should not have heard from her before next Tuesday or Wednesday."</quote>

<quote connection="s41279" id="s42301" mention="named1349" oid="369" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"Yes, so I imagined.  I was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of <mention>Miss Fairfax</mention> to-day."</quote>

<quote connection="s41283" id="s42302" mention="named1348" oid="370" speaker="Miss_Jane_Bates">"So obliging of you!  No, <mention>we</mention> should not have heard, if it had not been for this particular circumstance, of her being to come here so soon. My mother is so delighted!-- for she is to be three months with us at least.  Three months, she says so, positively, as I am going to have the pleasure of reading to you.  The case is, you see, that the Campbells are going to Ireland.  <mention>Mrs. Dixon</mention> has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly.  They had not intended to go over till the summer, but she is so impatient to see them again-- for till she married, last October, she was never away from them so much as a week, which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was going to say, but however different countries, and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother-- or her father, I declare I do not know which it was, but <mention>we</mention> shall see presently in Jane's letter-- wrote in Mr. Dixon's name as well as her own, to press their coming over directly, and they would give them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back to their country seat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy. <mention>Jane</mention> has heard a great deal of its beauty; from <mention>Mr. Dixon</mention>, I mean-- I do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else; but it was very natural, you know, that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses-- and as <mention>Jane</mention> used to be very often walking out with them-- for Colonel and <mention>Mrs. Campbell</mention> were very particular about their daughter's not walking out often with only Mr. Dixon, for which I do not at all blame them; of course she heard every thing he might be telling <mention>Miss Campbell</mention> about his own home in Ireland; and I think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place, views that he had taken himself.  He is a most amiable, charming young man, I believe.  <mention>Jane</mention> was quite longing to go to Ireland, from his account of things."</quote>

At this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma's brain with regard to <mention>Jane Fairfax</mention>, this charming Mr. Dixon, and the not going to Ireland, <mention connection="s42303,s42305,s42307" id="s42324" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">she</mention> said, with the insidious design of farther discovery,

<quote connection="s41283" id="s42304" oid="372" speaker="Miss_Jane_Bates">"Very true, very true, indeed.  The very thing that <mention>we</mention> have always been rather afraid of; for <mention>we</mention> should not have liked to have her at such a distance from us, for months together-- not able to come if any thing was to happen.  But you see, every thing turns out for the best.  They want her (Mr. and Mrs. Dixon) excessively to come over with Colonel and <mention>Mrs. Campbell</mention>; quite depend upon it; nothing can be more kind or pressing than their joint invitation, <mention>Jane</mention> says, as you will hear presently; <mention>Mr. Dixon</mention> does not seem in the least backward in any attention.  He is a most charming young man.  Ever since the service he rendered <mention>Jane</mention> at Weymouth, when they were out in that party on the water, and she, by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails, would have been dashed into the sea at once, and actually was all but gone, if he had not, with the greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her habit-- (I can never think of it without trembling!)-- But ever since <mention>we</mention> had the history of that day, I have been so fond of <mention>Mr. Dixon</mention>!"</quote>

And not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded.  She regained the street-- happy in this, that though much had been forced on her against her will, though she had in fact heard the whole substance of Jane Fairfax's letter, she had been able to escape the letter itself.</chapter><chapter>CHAPTER II

<mention>Jane Fairfax</mention> was an orphan, the only child of Mrs. Bates's youngest daughter.

The marriage of Lieut. Fairfax of the  regiment of infantry, and <mention>Miss Jane Bates</mention>, had had its day of fame and pleasure, hope and interest; but nothing now remained of it, save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroad-- of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards-- and this girl.

By birth she belonged to Highbury:  and when at three years old, on losing her mother, she became the property, the charge, the consolation, the fondling of her grandmother and aunt, there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there; of her being taught only what very limited means could command, and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement, to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person, good understanding, and warm-hearted, well-meaning relations.

But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny.  This was Colonel Campbell, who had very highly regarded Fairfax, as an excellent officer and most deserving young man; and farther, had been indebted to him for such attentions, during a severe camp-fever, as he believed had saved his life.  These were claims which he did not learn to overlook, though some years passed away from the death of poor Fairfax, before his own return to England put any thing in his power.  When he did return, he sought out the child and took notice of her.  He was a married man, with only one living child, a girl, about Jane's age:  and <mention>Jane</mention> became their guest, paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all; and before she was nine years old, his daughter's great fondness for her, and his own wish of being a real friend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education.  It was accepted; and from that period <mention>Jane</mention> had belonged to Colonel Campbell's family, and had lived with them entirely, only visiting her grandmother from time to time.

The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others; the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible.  To provide for her otherwise was out of Colonel Campbell's power; for though his income, by pay and appointments, was handsome, his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter's; but, by giving her an education, he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter.

Such was Jane Fairfax's history.  She had fallen into good hands, known nothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given an excellent education.  Living constantly with right-minded and well-informed people, her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture; and Colonel Campbell's residence being in London, every lighter talent had been done full justice to, by the attendance of first-rate masters.  Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do; and at eighteen or nineteen she was, as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children, fully competent to the office of instruction herself; but she was too much beloved to be parted with.  Neither father nor mother could promote, and the daughter could not endure it.  The evil day was put off.  It was easy to decide that she was still too young; and <mention>Jane</mention> remained with them, sharing, as another daughter, in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society, and a judicious mixture of home and amusement, with only the drawback of the future, the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over.

The affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of <mention>Miss Campbell</mention> in particular, was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of Jane's decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements.  That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents.  They continued together with unabated regard however, till the marriage of <mention>Miss Campbell</mention>, who by that chance, that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs, giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior, engaged the affections of <mention>Mr. Dixon</mention>, a young man, rich and agreeable, almost as soon as they were acquainted; and was eligibly and happily settled, while <mention>Jane Fairfax</mention> had yet her bread to earn.

This event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning.  She had long resolved that one-and-twenty should be the period.  With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate, she had resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice, and retire from all the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse, equal society, peace and hope, to penance and mortification for ever.

The good sense of Colonel and <mention>Mrs. Campbell</mention> could not oppose such a resolution, though their feelings did.  As long as they lived, no exertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever; and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly; but this would be selfishness:-- what must be at last, had better be soon. Perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay, and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished. Still, however, affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment.  She had never been quite well since the time of their daughter's marriage; and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength, they must forbid her engaging in duties, which, so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits, seemed, under the most favourable circumstances, to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort.

With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account to her aunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some truths not told.  It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to Highbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear: and the Campbells, whatever might be their motive or motives, whether single, or double, or treble, gave the arrangement their ready sanction, and said, that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air, for the recovery of her health, than on any thing else.  Certain it was that she was to come; and that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it-- Mr. Frank Churchill-- must put up for the present with <mention>Jane Fairfax</mention>, who could bring only the freshness of a two years' absence.

<mention>Emma</mention> was sorry;-- to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months!-- to be always doing more than she wished, and less than she ought!  Why she did not like <mention>Jane Fairfax</mention> might be a difficult question to answer; <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention> had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman, which she wanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time, there were moments of self-examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her.  But <quote connection="" id="s45309" oid="383" speaker="none">"she could never get acquainted with her: she did not know how it was, but there was such coldness and reserve-- such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not-- and then, her aunt was such an eternal talker!-- and she was made such a fuss with by every body!-- and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate-- because their ages were the same, every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other."</quote> These were her reasons-- she had no better.

It was a dislike so little just-- every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy, that she never saw <mention>Jane Fairfax</mention> the first time after any considerable absence, without feeling that she had injured her; and now, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two years' interval, she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating. <mention>Jane Fairfax</mention> was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had herself the highest value for elegance.  Her height was pretty, just such as almost every body would think tall, and nobody could think very tall; her figure particularly graceful; her size a most becoming medium, between fat and thin, though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two.  <mention>Emma</mention> could not but feel all this; and then, her face-- her features-- there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered; it was not regular, but it was very pleasing beauty.  Her eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows, had never been denied their praise; but the skin, which she had been used to cavil at, as wanting colour, had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom.  It was a style of beauty, of which elegance was the reigning character, and as such, she must, in honour, by all her principles, admire it:-- elegance, which, whether of person or of mind, she saw so little in Highbury.  There, not to be vulgar, was distinction, and merit.

In short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at <mention>Jane Fairfax</mention> with twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice, and was determining that she would dislike her no longer. When she took in her history, indeed, her situation, as well as her beauty; when she considered what all this elegance was destined to, what she was going to sink from, how she was going to live, it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect; especially, if to every well-known particular entitling her to interest, were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to <mention>Mr. Dixon</mention>, which she had so naturally started to herself.  In that case, nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on.  <mention>Emma</mention> was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon's actions from his wife, or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first.  If it were love, it might be simple, single, successless love on her side alone.  She might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison, while a sharer of his conversation with her friend; and from the best, the purest of motives, might now be denying herself this visit to Ireland, and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty.

Upon the whole, <mention>Emma</mention> left her with such softened, charitable feelings, as made her look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence; nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her.

These were charming feelings-- but not lasting.  Before <mention connection="s45310" id="s45320" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">she</mention> had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for <mention>Jane Fairfax</mention>, or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors, than saying to <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention>, <quote connection="s45320" id="s45310" mention="named1509" oid="384" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"She certainly is handsome; she is better than handsome!"</quote> Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state.  Former provocations reappeared.  The aunt was as tiresome as ever; more tiresome, because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast, and how small a slice of mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself; and Jane's offences rose again.  They had music; <mention>Emma</mention> was obliged to play; and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour, an air of greatness, meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance.  She was, besides, which was the worst of all, so cold, so cautious!  There was no getting at her real opinion.  Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness, she seemed determined to hazard nothing.  She was disgustingly, was suspiciously reserved.

If any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more reserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing.  She seemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon's character, or her own value for his company, or opinion of the suitableness of the match.  It was all general approbation and smoothness; nothing delineated or distinguished.  It did her no service however.  Her caution was thrown away.  <mention>Emma</mention> saw its artifice, and returned to her first surmises. There probably was something more to conceal than her own preference; <mention>Mr. Dixon</mention>, perhaps, had been very near changing one friend for the other, or been fixed only to <mention>Miss Campbell</mention>, for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds.

The like reserve prevailed on other topics.  <mention connection="s45312,s45314,s45316" id="s45318" speaker="Miss_Jane_Fairfax">She</mention> and <mention>Mr. Frank Churchill</mention> had been at Weymouth at the same time.

She believed every body found his manners pleasing."</quote> Emma could not forgive her.</chapter><chapter>CHAPTER III

<mention>Emma</mention> could not forgive her;-- but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by <mention>Mr. Knightley</mention>, who had been of the party, and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side, he was expressing the next morning, being at Hartfield again on business with <mention>Mr. Woodhouse</mention>, his approbation of the whole; not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room, but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to <mention>Emma</mention>.  He had been used to think her unjust to <mention>Jane</mention>, and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement.

Emma, alone with her father, had half her attention wanted by him while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry-- and to marry strangers too-- and the other half she could give to her own view of the subject.  It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece of news, as proving that <mention>Mr. Elton</mention> could not have suffered long; but she was sorry for <mention>Harriet</mention>: <mention>Harriet</mention> must feel it-- and all that she could hope was, by giving the first information herself, to save her from hearing it abruptly from others.  It was now about the time that she was likely to call.  If she were to meet <mention>Miss Bates</mention> in her way!-- and upon its beginning to rain, <mention>Emma</mention> was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at <mention>Mrs. Goddard</mention>'s, and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation.

The shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five minutes, when in came <mention connection="s48381" id="s48402" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">Harriet</mention>, with just the heated, agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and the <quote connection="s48402" id="s48381" oid="454" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"Oh! <mention>Miss Woodhouse</mention>, what do you think has happened!"</quote> which instantly burst forth, had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation.  As the blow was given, <mention>Emma</mention> felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in listening; and <mention connection="s48382,s48383" id="s48418" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">Harriet</mention>, unchecked, ran eagerly through what she had to tell.  <quote connection="s48418" id="s48382" oid="455" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"She had set out from <mention>Mrs. Goddard</mention>'s half an hour ago-- she had been afraid it would rain-- she had been afraid it would pour down every moment-- but she thought she might get to Hartfield first-- she had hurried on as fast as possible; but then, as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her, she thought she would just step in and see how it went on; and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there, soon after she came out it began to rain, and she did not know what to do; so she ran on directly, as fast as she could, and took shelter at Ford's."</quote>-- Ford's was the principal woollen-draper, linen-draper, and haberdasher's shop united; the shop first in size and fashion in the place.-- <quote connection="s48418" id="s48383" oid="456" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"And so, there she had set, without an idea of any thing in the world, full ten minutes, perhaps-- when, all of a sudden, who should come in-- to be sure it was so very odd!-- but they always dealt at Ford's-- who should come in, but <mention>Elizabeth Martin</mention> and her brother!-- Dear Miss Woodhouse! only think.  I thought I should have fainted.  I did not know what to do.  I was sitting near the door-- <mention>Elizabeth</mention> saw me directly; but he did not; he was busy with the umbrella.  I am sure she saw me, but she looked away directly, and took no notice; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop; and I kept sitting near the door!-- Oh! dear; I was so miserable!  I am sure I must have been as white as my gown.  I could not go away you know, because of the rain; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there.-- Oh! dear, Miss Woodhouse-- well, at last, I fancy, he looked round and saw me; for instead of going on with her buyings, they began whispering to one another.  I am sure they were talking of me; and I could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me-- (do you think he was, Miss Woodhouse?)-- for presently she came forward-- came quite up to me, and asked me how I did, and seemed ready to shake hands, if I would.  She did not do any of it in the same way that she used; I could see she was altered; but, however, she seemed to try to be very friendly, and <mention>we</mention> shook hands, and stood talking some time; but I know no more what I said -- I was in such a tremble! -- I remember she said she was sorry <mention>we</mention> never met now; which I thought almost too kind!  Dear, Miss Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable!  By that time, it was beginning to hold up, and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away-- and then-- only think!-- I found he was coming up towards me too-- slowly you know, and as if he did not quite know what to do; and so he came and spoke, and I answered-- and I stood for a minute, feeling dreadfully, you know, one can't tell how; and then I took courage, and said it did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not got three yards from the door, when he came after me, only to say, if I was going to Hartfield, he thought I had much better go round by Mr. Cole's stables, for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain. Oh! dear, I thought it would have been the death of me!  So I said, I was very much obliged to him:  you know I could not do less; and then he went back to <mention>Elizabeth</mention>, and I came round by the stables -- I believe I did-- but I hardly knew where I was, or any thing about it.  Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, I would rather done any thing than have it happen:  and yet, you know, there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly.  And Elizabeth, too.  Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, do talk to me and make me comfortable again."</quote>

Very sincerely did <mention>Emma</mention> wish to do so; but it was not immediately in her power.  She was obliged to stop and think.  She was not thoroughly comfortable herself.  The young man's conduct, and his sister's, seemed the result of real feeling, and she could not but pity them.  As <mention>Harriet</mention> described it, there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour.  But she had believed them to be well-meaning, worthy people before; and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion?  It was folly to be disturbed by it.  Of course, he must be sorry to lose her-- they must be all sorry.  Ambition, as well as love, had probably been mortified.  They might all have hoped to rise by Harriet's acquaintance:  and besides, what was the value of Harriet's description?-- So easily pleased-- so little discerning;-- what signified her praise?

She exerted herself, and did try to make her comfortable, by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle, and quite unworthy of being dwelt on,

<quote connection="s48403" id="s48384" oid="457" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"It might be distressing, for the moment,"</quote> said <mention connection="s48384,s48385" id="s48403" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">she</mention>; <quote connection="s48403" id="s48385" oid="458" speaker="Emma_Woodhouse">"but you seem to have behaved extremely well; and it is over-- and may never-- can never, as a first meeting, occur again, and therefore you need not think about it."</quote>

<mention connection="s48386,s48387" id="s48404" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">Harriet</mention> said, <quote connection="s48404" id="s48386" oid="459" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"very true,"</quote> and she <quote connection="s48404" id="s48387" oid="460" speaker="Miss_Harriet_Smith">"would not think about it;"</quote> but still she talked of it-- still she could talk of nothing else; and <mention>Emma</mention>, at last, in order to put the Martins out of her head, was obliged to hurry on the news, which she had meant to give with so much tender caution; hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry, ashamed or only amused, at such a state of mind in poor Harriet-- such a conclusion of Mr. Elton's importance with her!

Mr. Elton's rights, however, gradually revived.  Though she did not feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before, or an hour before, its interest soon increased; and before their first conversation was over, she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity, wonder and regret, pain and pleasure, as to this fortunate Miss Hawkins, which could conduce to place the Martins under proper subordination in her fancy.

<mention>Emma</mention> learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting.  It had been serviceable in deadening the first shock, without retaining any influence to alarm.  As <mention>Harriet</mention> now lived, the Martins could not get at her, without seeking her, where hitherto they had wanted either the courage or the condescension to seek her; for since her refusal of the brother, the sisters never had been at <mention>Mrs. Goddard</mention>'s; and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again, with any necessity, or even any power of speech.</chapter></text>
